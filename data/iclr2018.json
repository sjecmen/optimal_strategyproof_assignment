    "abstract": "  Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples and researchers have proposed many heuristic attack and defense mechanisms. We take the principled view of distributionally robust optimization, which guarantees performance under adversarial input perturbations.  By considering a Lagrangian penalty formulation of perturbation of the underlying data distribution in a Wasserstein ball, we provide a training procedure that augments model parameter updates with worst-case perturbations of training data. For smooth losses, our procedure provably achieves moderate levels of robustness with little computational or statistical cost relative to empirical risk minimization.  Furthermore, our statistical guarantees allow us to efficiently certify robustness for the population loss. For imperceptible perturbations, our method matches or outperforms heuristic approaches.\n",

A discrete time mean field game (MFG) is motivated as an interpretable model founded on game theory for understanding the aggregate effect of individual actions and predicting the temporal evolution of population distributions. We achieve a synthesis of MFG and Markov decision processes (MDP) by showing that a special MFG is reducible to an MDP. This enables us to broaden the scope of mean field game theory and infer MFG models of large real-world systems via deep inverse reinforcement learning. Our method learns both the reward function and forward dynamics of an MFG from real data, and we report the first empirical test of a mean field game model of a real-world social media population.",

    "abstract": " Several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods that have been successfully used in training deep networks such as RMSProp, Adam, Adadelta, Nadam, etc are based on using gradient updates scaled by square roots of exponential moving averages of squared past gradients. It has been empirically observed that sometimes these algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit example of a simple convex optimization setting where Adam does not converge to the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous analysis of Adam algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues may be fixed by endowing such algorithms with \"long-term memory\" of past gradients, and propose new variants of the Adam algorithm which not only fix the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research on the neural code underlying spatial navigation have revealed a diverse set of neural response properties. The Entorhinal Cortex (EC) of the mammalian brain contains a rich set of spatial correlates, including grid cells which encode space using tessellating patterns. However, the mechanisms and functional significance of these spatial representations remain largely mysterious. As a new way to understand these neural representations, we trained recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to perform navigation tasks in 2D arenas based on velocity inputs. Surprisingly, we find that grid-like spatial response patterns emerge in trained networks, along with units that exhibit other spatial correlates, including border cells and band-like cells. All these different functional types of neurons have been observed experimentally. The order of the emergence of grid-like and border cells is also consistent with observations from developmental studies. Together, our results suggest that grid cells, border cells and others as observed in EC may be a natural solution for representing space efficiently given the predominant recurrent connections in the neural circuits.\n",

Two such settings are: 1. anytime classification, where the network\u2019s prediction for a test example is progressively updated, facilitating the output of a prediction at any time; and 2. budgeted batch classification, where a fixed amount of computation is available to classify a set of examples that can be spent unevenly across \u201ceasier\u201d and \u201charder\u201d inputs. In contrast to most prior work, such as the popular Viola and Jones algorithm, our approach is based on convolutional neural networks. We train multiple classifiers with varying resource demands, which we adaptively apply during test time. To maximally re-use computation between the classifiers, we incorporate them as early-exits into a single deep convolutional neural network and inter-connect them with dense connectivity. To facilitate high quality classification early on, we use a two-dimensional multi-scale network architecture that maintains coarse and fine level features all-throughout the network. Experiments on three image-classification tasks demonstrate that our framework substantially improves the existing state-of-the-art in both settings.",

    "abstract": "It is widely believed that the success of deep convolutional networks is based on progressively discarding uninformative variability about the input with respect to the problem at hand. This is supported empirically by the difficulty of recovering images from their hidden representations, in most commonly used network architectures. In this paper we show that this loss of information is not a necessary condition to learn representations that generalize well on complicated problems, such as ImageNet. Via a cascade of homeomorphic layers, we build the i-RevNet, a network that can be fully inverted up to the final projection onto the classes, i.e. no information is discarded. Building an invertible architecture is difficult, for example, because the local inversion is ill-conditioned, we overcome this by providing an explicit inverse.\nAn analysis of i-RevNet\u2019s learned representations suggests an explanation of the good accuracy by a progressive contraction and linear separation with depth. To shed light on the nature of the model learned by the i-RevNet we reconstruct linear interpolations between natural images representations.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the method of choice for learning problems involving 2D planar images. However, a number of problems of recent interest have created a demand for models that can analyze spherical images. Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and autonomous cars, molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate modelling. A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection of the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying distortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight sharing ineffective.\n\nIn this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical CNNs. We propose a definition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both expressive and rotation-equivariant. The spherical correlation satisfies a generalized Fourier theorem, which allows us to compute it efficiently using a generalized (non-commutative) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We demonstrate the computational efficiency, numerical accuracy, and effectiveness of spherical CNNs applied to 3D model recognition and atomization energy regression.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection on multi- or high-dimensional data is of great importance in both fundamental machine learning research and industrial applications, for which density estimation lies at the core. Although previous approaches based on dimensionality reduction followed by density estimation have made fruitful progress, they mainly suffer from decoupled model learning with inconsistent optimization goals and incapability of preserving essential information in the low-dimensional space. In this paper, we present a Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our model utilizes a deep autoencoder to generate a low-dimensional representation and reconstruction error for each input data point, which is further fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Instead of using decoupled two-stage training and the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, DAGMM jointly optimizes the parameters of the deep autoencoder and the mixture model simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion, leveraging a separate estimation network to facilitate the parameter learning of the mixture model. The joint optimization, which well balances autoencoding reconstruction, density estimation of latent representation, and regularization, helps the autoencoder escape from less attractive local optima and further reduce reconstruction errors, avoiding the need of pre-training. Experimental results on several public benchmark datasets show that, DAGMM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, and achieves up to 14% improvement based on the standard F1 score.",

We propose to use graphs to represent both the syntactic and semantic structure of code and use graph-based deep learning methods to learn to reason over program structures.\n\nIn this work, we present how to construct graphs from source code and how to scale Gated Graph Neural Networks training to such large graphs. We evaluate our method on two tasks: VarNaming, in which a network attempts to predict the name of a variable given its usage, and VarMisuse, in which the network learns to reason about selecting the correct variable that should be used at a given program location. Our comparison to methods that use less structured program representations shows the advantages of modeling known structure, and suggests that our models learn to infer meaningful names and to solve the VarMisuse task in many cases. Additionally, our testing showed that VarMisuse identifies a number of bugs in mature open-source projects.",

    "abstract": "The driving force behind deep networks is their ability to compactly represent rich classes of functions. The primary notion for formally reasoning about this phenomenon is expressive efficiency, which refers to a situation where one network must grow unfeasibly large in order to replicate functions of another. To date, expressive efficiency analyses focused on the architectural feature of depth, showing that deep networks are representationally superior to shallow ones. In this paper we study the expressive efficiency brought forth by connectivity, motivated by the observation that modern networks interconnect their layers in elaborate ways. We focus on dilated convolutional networks, a family of deep models delivering state of the art performance in sequence processing tasks. By introducing and analyzing the concept of mixed tensor decompositions, we prove that interconnecting dilated convolutional networks can lead to expressive efficiency. In particular, we show that even a single connection between intermediate layers can already lead to an almost quadratic gap, which in large-scale settings typically makes the difference between a model that is practical and one that is not. Empirical evaluation demonstrates how the expressive efficiency of connectivity, similarly to that of depth, translates into gains in accuracy. This leads us to believe that expressive efficiency may serve a key role in developing new tools for deep network design.",

    "abstract": "Existing approaches to imitation learning distill both what to do---goals---and how to do it---skills---from expert demonstrations. This expertise is effective but expensive supervision: it is not always practical to collect many detailed demonstrations. We argue that if an agent has access to its environment along with the expert, it can learn skills from its own experience and rely on expertise for the goals alone. We weaken the expert supervision required to a single visual demonstration of the task, that is, observation of the expert without knowledge of the actions. Our method is ``zero-shot'' in that we never see expert actions and never see demonstrations during learning. Through self-supervised exploration our agent learns to act and to recognize its actions so that it can infer expert actions once given a demonstration in deployment. During training the agent learns a skill policy for reaching a target observation from the current observation. During inference, the expert demonstration communicates the goals to imitate while the skill policy determines how to imitate. Our novel skill policy architecture and dynamics consistency loss extend visual imitation to more complex environments while improving robustness. Our zero-shot imitator, having no prior knowledge of the environment and making no use of the expert during training, learns from experience to follow experts for navigating an office with a turtlebot, and manipulating rope with a baxter robot.

    "abstract": "Options in reinforcement learning allow agents to hierarchically decompose a task into subtasks, having the potential to speed up learning and planning. However, autonomously learning effective sets of options is still a major challenge in the field. In this paper we focus on the recently introduced idea of using representation learning methods to guide the option discovery process. Specifically, we look at eigenoptions, options obtained from representations that encode diffusive information flow in the environment. We extend the existing algorithms for eigenoption discovery to settings with stochastic transitions and in which handcrafted features are not available.  We propose an algorithm that discovers eigenoptions while learning non-linear state representations from raw pixels. It exploits recent successes in the deep reinforcement learning literature and the equivalence between proto-value functions and the successor representation. We use traditional tabular domains to provide intuition about our approach and Atari 2600 games to demonstrate its potential.",

Here, we describe a modular continual reinforcement learning paradigm inspired by these abilities. We first introduce a visual interaction environment that allows many types of tasks to be unified in a single framework. We then describe a reward map prediction scheme that learns new tasks robustly in the very large state and action spaces required by such an environment. We investigate how properties of module architecture influence efficiency of task learning, showing that a module motif incorporating specific design principles (e.g. early bottlenecks, low-order polynomial nonlinearities, and symmetry) significantly outperforms more standard neural network motifs, needing fewer training examples and fewer neurons to achieve high levels of performance. Finally, we present a meta-controller architecture for task switching based on a dynamic neural voting scheme, which allows new modules to use information learned from previously-seen tasks to substantially improve their own learning efficiency.

    "abstract": "Momentum based stochastic gradient methods such as heavy ball (HB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent (NAG) method are widely used in practice for training deep networks and other supervised learning models, as they often provide significant improvements over stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Theoretically, these ```fast gradient methods have provable improvements over gradient descent only for the deterministic case, where the gradients are exact. In the stochastic case, the popular explanations for their wide applicability is that when these fast gradient methods are applied in the stochastic case, they partially mimic their exact gradient counterparts, resulting in some practical gain. This work provides a counterpoint to this belief by proving that there are simple problem instances where these methods cannot outperform SGD despite the best setting of its parameters. These negative problem instances are, in an informal sense, generic; they do not look like carefully constructed pathological instances. These results suggest (along with empirical evidence) that HB or NAG's practical performance gains are a by-product of minibatching.\n\nFurthermore, this work provides a viable (and provable) alternative, which, on the same set of problem instances, significantly improves over HB, NAG, and SGD's performance. This algorithm, referred to as Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD), is a simple to implement stochastic algorithm, based on a relatively less popular variant of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Descent. Extensive empirical results in this paper show that ASGD has performance gains over HB, NAG, and SGD.\n",

For example, it can be used to simulate the environment, or to infer the state of parts of the world that are currently unobserved. In order to match real-world conditions this causal knowledge must be learned without access to supervised data.  To address this problem we present a novel method that learns to discover objects, and models their physical interactions from raw visual images in a purely unsupervised fashion. It incorporates prior knowledge about the compositional nature of human perception to factor interactions between object-pairs and learn efficiently. On videos of bouncing balls we show the superior modelling capabilities of our method compared to other unsupervised neural approaches that do not incorporate such prior knowledge. We demonstrate its ability to handle occlusion and show that it can extrapolate learned knowledge to environments with varying numbers of objects.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks have achieved excellent performance in many applications. However, on portable devices with limited resources, the models are often too large to deploy. For applications on the server with large scale concurrent requests, the latency during inference can also be very critical for costly computing resources. In this work, we address these problems by quantizing the network, both weights and activations, into multiple binary codes {-1,+1}. We formulate the quantization as an optimization problem. Under the key observation that once the quantization coefficients are fixed the binary codes can be derived efficiently by binary search tree, alternating minimization is then applied.  We test the quantization for two well-known RNNs, i.e., long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), on the language models. Compared with the full-precision counter part, by 2-bit quantization we can achieve ~16x memory saving and  ~6x real inference acceleration on CPUs, with only a reasonable loss in the accuracy. By 3-bit quantization, we can achieve almost no loss in the accuracy or even surpass the original model, with ~10.5x memory saving and ~3x real inference acceleration. Both results beat the exiting quantization works with large margins.  We extend our alternating quantization to image classification tasks. In both RNNs and feedforward neural networks, the method also achieves  excellent performance.",

Our work builds on recent advances in the training of deep networks on user-partitioned data and privacy accounting for stochastic gradient descent. In particular, we add user-level privacy protection to the federated averaging algorithm, which makes large step updates from user-level data. Our work demonstrates that given a dataset with a sufficiently large number of users (a requirement easily met by even small internet-scale datasets), achieving differential privacy comes at the cost of increased computation, rather than in decreased utility as in most prior work.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation refers to the problem of leveraging labeled data in a source domain to learn an accurate model in a target domain where labels are scarce or unavailable. A recent approach for finding a common representation of the two domains is via domain adversarial training (Ganin &amp; Lempitsky, 2015), which attempts to induce a feature extractor that matches the source and target feature distributions in some feature space. However, domain adversarial training faces two critical limitations: 1) if the feature extraction function has high-capacity, then feature distribution matching is a weak constraint, 2) in non-conservative domain adaptation (where no single classifier can perform well in both the source and target domains), training the model to do well on the source domain hurts performance on the target domain. In this paper, we address these issues through the lens of the cluster assumption, i.e., decision boundaries should not cross high-density data regions. We propose two novel and related models: 1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) model, which combines domain adversarial training with a penalty term that punishes the violation the cluster assumption; 2) the Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T) model, which takes the VADA model as initialization and employs natural gradient steps to further minimize the cluster assumption violation. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the combination of these two models significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on several visual domain adaptation benchmarks.",

We propose two modifications to Winograd-based CNNs to enable these methods to exploit sparsity. First, we move the ReLU operation into the Winograd domain to increase the sparsity of the transformed activations. Second, we prune the weights in the Winograd domain to exploit static weight sparsity. For models on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, our method reduces the number of multiplications by 10.4x, 6.8x and 10.8x respectively with loss of accuracy less than 0.1%, outperforming previous baselines by 2.0x-3.0x. We also show that moving ReLU to the Winograd domain allows more aggressive pruning.",

    "abstract": "We propose a neural language model capable of unsupervised syntactic structure induction. The model leverages the structure information to form better semantic representations and better language modeling. Standard recurrent neural networks are limited by their structure and fail to efficiently use syntactic information. On the other hand, tree-structured recursive networks usually require additional structural supervision at the cost of human expert annotation. In this paper, We propose a novel neural language model, called the Parsing-Reading-Predict Networks (PRPN), that can simultaneously induce the syntactic structure from unannotated sentences and leverage the inferred structure to learn a better language model. In our model, the gradient can be directly back-propagated from the language model loss into the neural parsing network. Experiments show that the proposed model can discover the underlying syntactic structure and achieve state-of-the-art performance on word/character-level language model tasks.",

    "abstract": "A critical component to enabling intelligent reasoning in partially observable environments is memory. Despite this importance, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents have so far used relatively simple memory architectures, with the main methods to overcome partial observability being either a temporal convolution over the past k frames or an LSTM layer. More recent work (Oh et al., 2016) has went beyond these architectures by using memory networks which can allow more sophisticated addressing schemes over the past k frames. But even these architectures are unsatisfactory due to the reason that they are limited to only remembering information from the last k frames. In this paper, we develop a memory system with an adaptable write operator that is customized to the sorts of 3D environments that DRL agents typically interact with. This architecture, called the Neural Map, uses a spatially structured 2D memory image to learn to store arbitrary information about the environment over long time lags. We demonstrate empirically that the Neural Map surpasses previous DRL memories on a set of challenging 2D and 3D maze environments and show that it is capable of generalizing to environments that were not seen during training.

    "abstract": "Researches on deep neural networks with discrete parameters and their deployment in embedded systems have been active and promising topics. Although previous works have successfully reduced precision in inference, transferring both training and inference processes to low-bitwidth integers has not been demonstrated simultaneously. In this work, we develop a new method termed as ``\"WAGE\" to discretize both training and inference, where weights (W), activations (A), gradients (G) and errors (E) among layers are shifted and linearly constrained to low-bitwidth integers. To perform pure discrete dataflow for fixed-point devices, we further replace batch normalization by a constant scaling layer and simplify other components that are arduous for integer implementation. Improved accuracies can be obtained on multiple datasets, which indicates that WAGE somehow acts as a type of regularization. Empirically, we demonstrate the potential to deploy training in hardware systems such as integer-based deep learning accelerators and neuromorphic chips with comparable accuracy and higher energy efficiency, which is crucial to future AI applications in variable scenarios with transfer and continual learning demands.",

    "abstract": "Machine translation has recently achieved impressive performance thanks to recent advances in deep learning and the availability of large-scale parallel corpora. There have been numerous attempts to extend these successes to low-resource language pairs, yet requiring tens of thousands of parallel sentences. In this work, we take this research direction to the extreme and investigate whether it is possible to learn to translate even without any parallel data. We propose a model that takes sentences from monolingual corpora in two different languages and maps them into the same latent space. By learning to reconstruct in both languages from this shared feature space, the model effectively learns to translate without using any labeled data. We demonstrate our model on two widely used datasets and two language pairs, reporting BLEU scores of 32.8 and 15.1 on the Multi30k and WMT English-French datasets, without using even a single parallel sentence at training time.",

The performant systems, however, typically involve big models with numerous parameters. Once trained, a challenging aspect for such top performing models is deployment on resource constrained inference systems -- the models (often deep networks or wide networks or both) are compute and memory intensive. Low precision numerics and model compression using knowledge distillation are popular techniques to lower both the compute requirements and memory footprint of these deployed models. In this paper, we study the combination of these two techniques and show that the performance of low precision networks can be significantly improved by using knowledge distillation techniques. We call our approach Apprentice and show state-of-the-art accuracies using ternary precision and 4-bit precision for many variants of ResNet architecture on ImageNet dataset. We study three schemes in which one can apply knowledge distillation techniques to various stages of the train-and-deploy pipeline.",

We preserve the dependency structure between the labels with a given causal graph. We devise a two-stage procedure for learning a CiGM over the labels and the image. First we train a CiGM over the binary labels using a  Wasserstein GAN where the generator neural network is consistent with the causal graph between the labels. Later, we combine this with a conditional GAN to generate images conditioned on the binary labels. We propose two new conditional GAN architectures: CausalGAN and CausalBEGAN. We show that the optimal generator of the CausalGAN, given the labels, samples from the image distributions conditioned on these labels. The conditional GAN combined with a trained CiGM for the labels is then a CiGM over the labels and the generated image.

We consider the task of learning an implicit generative model given only lossy measurements of samples from the distribution of interest. We show that the true underlying distribution can be provably recovered even in the presence of per-sample information loss for a class of measurement models.

    "abstract": "Many machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to almost imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. So far it was unclear how much risk adversarial perturbations carry for the safety of real-world machine learning applications because most methods used to generate such perturbations rely either on detailed model information (gradient-based attacks) or on confidence scores such as class probabilities (score-based attacks), neither of which are available in most real-world scenarios. In many such cases one currently needs to retreat to transfer-based attacks which rely on cumbersome substitute models, need access to the training data and can be defended against. Here we emphasise the importance of attacks which solely rely on the final model decision. Such decision-based attacks are (1) applicable to real-world black-box models such as autonomous cars, (2) need less knowledge and are easier to apply than transfer-based attacks and (3) are more robust to simple defences than gradient- or score-based attacks. Previous attacks in this category were limited to simple models or simple datasets. Here we introduce the Boundary Attack, a decision-based attack that starts from a large adversarial perturbation and then seeks to reduce the perturbation while staying adversarial. The attack is conceptually simple, requires close to no hyperparameter tuning, does not rely on substitute models and is competitive with the best gradient-based attacks in standard computer vision tasks like ImageNet. We apply the attack on two black-box algorithms from Clarifai.com. The Boundary Attack in particular and the class of decision-based attacks in general open new avenues to study the robustness of machine learning models and raise new questions regarding the safety of deployed machine learning systems. An implementation of the attack is available at XXXXXX.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new neural structure called FusionNet, which extends existing attention approaches from three perspectives. First, it puts forward a novel concept of \"History of Word\" to characterize attention information from the lowest word-level embedding up to the highest semantic-level representation. Second, it identifies an attention scoring function that better utilizes the \"history of word\" concept. Third, it proposes a fully-aware multi-level attention mechanism to capture the complete information in one text (such as a question) and exploit it in its counterpart (such as context or passage) layer by layer. We apply FusionNet to the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and it achieves the first position for both single and ensemble model on the official SQuAD leaderboard at the time of writing (Oct. 4th, 2017). Meanwhile, we verify the generalization of FusionNet with two adversarial SQuAD datasets and it sets up the new state-of-the-art on both datasets: on AddSent, FusionNet increases the best F1 metric from 46.6% to 51.4%; on AddOneSent, FusionNet boosts the best F1 metric from 56.0% to 60.7%.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted instances that can mislead DNNs to make errors during prediction. To better understand such attacks, a characterization is needed of the properties of regions (the so-called 'adversarial subspaces') in which adversarial examples lie. In particular, effective measures are required to discriminate adversarial examples from normal examples in such regions. We tackle this challenge by characterizing the dimensional properties of adversarial regions, via the use of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). LID assesses the space-filling capability of the region surrounding a reference example, based on the distance distribution of the example to its neighbors. We first provide explanations about how adversarial perturbation can affect the LID characteristic of adversarial regions, and then show empirically that LID characteristics can facilitate the detection of adversarial examples generated using the state-of-the-art attacks. We show that when applied for adversarial detection, an LID-based method can outperform several state-of-the-art detection measures by large margins for five attack strategies across three benchmark datasets. Our analysis of the LID characteristic for adversarial regions not only motivates new directions of effective adversarial defense, but also opens up more challenges for developing new attacks to better understand the vulnerabilities of DNNs.",

Since the encoders and decoders in DNN-based compression methods are neural networks with feature-maps as internal representations of the images, we directly integrate these with architectures for image understanding. This bypasses decoding of the compressed representation into RGB space and reduces computational cost. Our study shows that accuracies comparable to networks that operate on compressed RGB images can be achieved while reducing the computational complexity up to $2\\times$. Furthermore, we show that synergies are obtained by jointly training compression networks with classification networks on the compressed representations, improving image quality, classification accuracy, and segmentation performance. We find that inference from compressed representations is particularly advantageous compared to inference from compressed RGB images for aggressive compression rates.",

CROSSGRAD does not need an adaptation phase via labeled or unlabeled data, or domain features in the new domain. Most existing domain adaptation methods attempt to erase domain signals using techniques like domain adversarial training. In contrast, CROSSGRAD is free to use domain signals for predicting labels, if it can prevent overfitting on training domains. We conceptualize the task in a Bayesian setting, in which a sampling step is implemented as data augmentation, based on domain-guided perturbations of input instances. CROSSGRAD jointly trains a label and a domain classifier on examples perturbed by loss gradients of each other\u2019s objectives. This enables us to directly perturb inputs, without separating and re-mixing domain signals while making various distributional assumptions.

    "abstract": "Skip connections made the training of very deep networks possible and have become an indispensable component in a variety of neural architectures. A completely satisfactory explanation for their success remains elusive. Here, we present a novel explanation for the benefits of skip connections in training very deep networks. The difficulty of training deep networks is partly due to the singularities caused by the non-identifiability of the model. Several such singularities have been identified in previous works: (i) overlap singularities caused by the permutation symmetry of nodes in a given layer, (ii) elimination singularities corresponding to the elimination, i.e. consistent deactivation, of nodes, (iii) singularities generated by the linear dependence of the nodes. These singularities cause degenerate manifolds in the loss landscape that slow down learning. We argue that skip connections eliminate these singularities by breaking the permutation symmetry of nodes, by reducing the possibility of node elimination and by making the nodes less linearly dependent. Moreover, for typical initializations, skip connections move the network away from the \"ghosts\" of these singularities and sculpt the landscape around them to alleviate the learning slow-down. These hypotheses are supported by evidence from simplified models, as well as from experiments with deep networks trained on real-world datasets.",

Learning in such models is difficult, however, because exact marginalization over these combinatorial objects is intractable. In response, this paper introduces a collection of new methods for end-to-end learning in such models that approximate discrete maximum-weight matching using the continuous Sinkhorn operator.  Sinkhorn iteration is attractive because it functions as a simple, easy-to-implement analog of the softmax operator. With this, we can define the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, an extension of the Gumbel-Softmax method (Jang et al. 2016, Maddison2016 et al. 2016) to distributions over latent matchings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by outperforming competitive baselines on a range of qualitatively different tasks: sorting numbers, solving jigsaw puzzles, and identifying neural signals in worms.

    "abstract": "Teaching plays a very important role in our society, by spreading human knowledge and educating our next generations. A good teacher will select appropriate teaching materials, impact suitable methodologies, and set up targeted examinations, according to the learning behaviors of the students. In the field of artificial intelligence, however, one has not fully explored the role of teaching, and pays most attention to machine \\emph{learning}. In this paper, we argue that equal attention, if not more, should be paid to teaching, and furthermore, an optimization framework (instead of heuristics) should be used to obtain good teaching strategies. We call this approach ``learning to teach''. In the approach, two intelligent agents interact with each other: a student model (which corresponds to the learner in traditional machine learning algorithms), and a teacher model (which determines the appropriate data, loss function, and hypothesis space to facilitate the training of the student model). The teacher model leverages the feedback from the student model to optimize its own teaching strategies by means of reinforcement learning, so as to achieve teacher-student co-evolution. To demonstrate the practical value of our proposed approach, we take the training of deep neural networks (DNN) as an example, and show that by using the learning to teach techniques, we are able to use much less training data and fewer iterations to achieve almost the same accuracy for different kinds of DNN models (e.g., multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) under various machine learning tasks (e.g., image classification and text understanding).",

Defenses based on regularization and adversarial training have been proposed, but often followed by new, stronger attacks that defeat these defenses. Can we somehow end this arms race? In this work, we study this problem for neural networks with one hidden layer. We first propose a method based on a semidefinite relaxation that outputs a certificate that for a given network and test input, no attack can force the error to exceed a certain value. Second, as this certificate is differentiable, we jointly optimize it with the network parameters, providing an adaptive regularizer that encourages robustness against all attacks. On MNIST, our approach produces a network and a certificate that no that perturbs each pixel by at most $\\epsilon = 0.1$ can cause more than $35\\%$ test error.\n",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) usually contain millions, maybe billions, of parameters/weights, making both storage and computation very expensive. This has motivated a large body of work to reduce the complexity of the neural network by using sparsity-inducing regularizers.  Another well-known approach for controlling the complexity of DNNs is parameter sharing/tying, where certain sets of weights are forced to share a common value. Some forms of weight sharing are hard-wired to express certain in- variances, with a notable example being the shift-invariance of convolutional layers. However, there may be other groups of weights that may be tied together during the learning process, thus further re- ducing the complexity of the network. In this paper, we adopt a recently proposed sparsity-inducing regularizer, named GrOWL (group ordered weighted l1), which encourages sparsity and, simulta- neously, learns which groups of parameters should share a common value. GrOWL has been proven effective in linear regression, being able to identify and cope with strongly correlated covariates. Unlike standard sparsity-inducing regularizers (e.g., l1 a.k.a. Lasso), GrOWL not only eliminates unimportant neurons by setting all the corresponding weights to zero, but also explicitly identifies strongly correlated neurons by tying the corresponding weights to a common value. This ability of GrOWL motivates the following two-stage procedure: (i) use GrOWL regularization in the training process to simultaneously identify significant neurons and groups of parameter that should be tied together; (ii) retrain the network, enforcing the structure that was unveiled in the previous phase, i.e., keeping only the significant neurons and enforcing the learned tying structure. We evaluate the proposed approach on several benchmark datasets, showing that it can dramatically compress the network with slight or even no loss on generalization performance.\n",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method to perform transfer learning across domains and tasks, formulating it as a problem of learning to cluster. The key insight is that, in addition to features, we can transfer similarity information and this is sufficient to learn a similarity function and clustering network to perform both domain adaptation and cross-task transfer learning. We begin by reducing categorical information to pairwise constraints, which only considers whether two instances belong to the same class or not (pairwise semantic similarity). This similarity is category-agnostic and can be learned from data in the source domain using a similarity network. We then present two novel approaches for performing transfer learning using this similarity function. First, for unsupervised domain adaptation, we design a new loss function to regularize classification with a constrained clustering loss, hence learning a clustering network with the transferred similarity metric generating the training inputs. Second, for cross-task learning (i.e., unsupervised clustering with unseen categories), we propose a framework to reconstruct and estimate the number of semantic clusters, again using the clustering network. Since the similarity network is noisy, the key is to use a robust clustering algorithm, and we show that our formulation is more robust than the alternative constrained and unconstrained clustering approaches. Using this method, we first show state of the art results for the challenging cross-task problem, applied on Omniglot and ImageNet. Our results show that we can reconstruct semantic clusters with high accuracy. We then evaluate the performance of cross-domain transfer using images from the Office-31 and SVHN-MNIST tasks and present top accuracy on both datasets.  Our approach doesn't explicitly deal with domain discrepancy. If we combine with a domain adaptation loss, it shows further improvement.",

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) with neural networks leverages commonalities in tasks to improve performance, but often suffers from task interference which reduces the benefits of transfer. To address this issue we introduce the routing network paradigm, a novel neural network and training algorithm. A routing network is a kind of self-organizing neural network consisting of two components: a router and a set of one or more function blocks. A function block may be any neural network \u2013 for example a fully-connected or a convolutional layer. Given an input the router makes a routing decision, choosing a function block to apply and passing the output back to the router recursively, terminating when a fixed recursion depth is reached. In this way the routing network dynamically composes different function blocks for each input. We employ a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to jointly train the router and function blocks. We evaluate our model against cross-stitch networks and shared-layer baselines on multi-task settings of the MNIST, mini-imagenet, and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our experiments demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, with sharper convergence. In addition, routing networks have nearly constant per-task training cost while cross-stitch networks scale linearly with the number of tasks. On CIFAR100 (20 tasks) we obtain cross-stitch performance levels with an 85% average reduction in training time.\n",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) continue to make significant advances, solving tasks from image classification to translation or reinforcement learning. One aspect of the field receiving considerable attention is efficiently executing deep models in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile or embedded devices. This paper focuses on this problem, and proposes two new compression methods, which jointly leverage weight quantization and distillation of larger teacher networks into smaller student networks. The first method we propose is called quantized distillation and leverages distillation during the training process, by incorporating distillation loss, expressed with respect to the teacher, into the training of a student network whose weights are quantized to a limited set of levels. The second method,  differentiable quantization, optimizes the location of quantization points through stochastic gradient descent, to better fit the behavior of the teacher model.  We validate both methods through experiments on convolutional and recurrent architectures. We show that quantized shallow students can reach similar accuracy levels to full-precision teacher models, while providing order of magnitude compression, and inference speedup that is linear in the depth reduction. In sum, our results enable DNNs for resource-constrained environments to leverage architecture and accuracy advances developed on more powerful devices.\n",

    "abstract": "For every prediction we might wish to make, we must decide what to observe (what source of information) and when to observe it. Because making observations is costly, this decision must trade off the value of information against the cost of observation. Making observations (sensing) should be an active choice. To solve the problem of active sensing we develop a novel deep learning architecture: Deep Sensing. At training time, Deep Sensing learns how to issue predictions at various cost-performance points. To do this, it creates multiple representations at various performance levels associated with different measurement rates (costs). This requires learning how to estimate the value of real measurements vs. inferred measurements, which in turn requires learning how to infer missing (unobserved) measurements.  To infer missing measurements, we develop a Multi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (M-RNN).  An M-RNN differs from a bi-directional RNN in that it sequentially operates across streams in addition to within streams, and because the timing of inputs into the hidden layers is both lagged and advanced.  At runtime, the operator prescribes a performance level or a cost constraint, and Deep Sensing determines what measurements to take and what to infer from those measurements, and then issues predictions. To demonstrate the power of our method, we apply it to two real-world medical datasets with significantly improved performance.",

    "abstract": "Localization is the problem of estimating the location of an autonomous agent from an observation and a map of the environment. Traditional methods of localization, which filter the belief based on the observations, are sub-optimal in the number of steps required, as they do not decide the actions taken by the agent. We propose \"Active Neural Localizer\", a fully differentiable neural network that learns to localize efficiently. The proposed model incorporates ideas of traditional filtering-based localization methods, by using a structured belief of the state with multiplicative interactions to propagate belief, and combines it with a policy model to minimize the number of steps required for localization. Active Neural Localizer is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning. We use a variety of simulation environments for our experiments which include random 2D mazes, random mazes in the Doom game engine and a photo-realistic environment in the Unreal game engine. The results on the 2D environments show the effectiveness of the learned policy in an idealistic setting while results on the 3D environments demonstrate the model's capability of learning the policy and perceptual model jointly from raw-pixel based RGB observations. We also show that a model trained on random textures in the Doom environment generalizes well to a photo-realistic office space environment in the Unreal engine. ",

    "abstract": "The novel \\emph{Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization} (UORO) algorithm allows for online learning of general recurrent computational graphs such as recurrent network models. It works in a streaming fashion and avoids backtracking through past activations and inputs. UORO is computationally as costly as \\emph{Truncated Backpropagation Through Time} (truncated BPTT), a widespread algorithm for online learning of recurrent networks \\cite{jaeger2002tutorial}.  UORO is a modification of \\emph{NoBackTrack} \\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/OllivierC15} that bypasses the need for model sparsity and makes implementation easy in current deep learning frameworks, even for complex models.  Like NoBackTrack, UORO provides unbiased gradient estimates; unbiasedness is the core hypothesis in stochastic gradient descent theory, without which convergence to a local optimum is not guaranteed. On the contrary, truncated BPTT does not provide this property, leading to possible divergence.  On synthetic tasks where truncated BPTT is shown to diverge, UORO converges. For instance, when a parameter has a positive short-term but negative long-term influence, truncated BPTT diverges unless the truncation span is very significantly longer than the intrinsic temporal range of the interactions, while UORO performs well thanks to the unbiasedness of its gradients.\n",

Recent theoretical results have shown that optimistic mirror decent (OMD) can enjoy faster regret rates in the context of zero-sum games. WGANs is exactly a context of solving a zero-sum game with simultaneous no-regret dynamics.  Moreover, we show that optimistic mirror decent addresses the limit cycling problem in training WGANs. We formally show that in the case of bi-linear zero-sum games the last iterate of OMD dynamics converges to an equilibrium, in contrast to GD dynamics which are bound to cycle. We also portray the huge qualitative difference between GD and OMD dynamics with toy examples, even when GD is modified with many adaptations proposed in the recent literature, such as gradient penalty or momentum. We apply OMD WGAN training to a bioinformatics problem of generating DNA sequences. We observe that models trained with OMD achieve consistently smaller KL divergence with respect to the true underlying distribution, than models trained with GD variants. Finally, we introduce a new algorithm, Optimistic Adam, which is an optimistic variant of Adam. We apply it to WGAN training on CIFAR10 and observe improved performance in terms of inception score as compared to Adam.",

Such contextual bandit feedback can be available in huge quantities (e.g., logs of search engines, recommender systems) at little cost, opening up a path for training deep networks on orders of magnitude more data. To this effect, we propose a counterfactual risk minimization approach for training deep networks using an equivariant empirical risk estimator with variance regularization, BanditNet, and show how the resulting objective can be decomposed in a way that allows stochastic gradient descent training. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in two scenarios.

Yet, our understanding of RL methods has been shaped by theoretical and empirical results with tabular representations and linear function approximators. These results suggest that RL methods using temporal differencing (TD) are superior to direct Monte Carlo (MC) estimation. In this paper, we re-examine the role of TD in modern deep RL, using specially designed environments that each control for a specific factor that affects performance, such as reward sparsity, reward delay or the perceptual complexity of the task. When comparing TD with infinite horizon MC, we are able to reproduce the results from the past in modern settings characterized by perceptual complexity and deep nonlinear models. However, we also find that finite horizon MC methods are not inferior to TD, even in sparse or delayed reward tasks, making MC a viable alternative to TD. We discuss the role of perceptual complexity in reconciling these findings with classic empirical results.",

Deploying neural NLP models to mobile devices requires compressing the word embeddings without any significant sacrifices in performance. For this purpose, we propose to construct the embeddings with few basis vectors. For each word, the composition of basis vectors is determined by a hash code. To maximize the compression rate, we adopt the multi-codebook quantization approach instead of binary coding scheme. Each code is composed of multiple discrete numbers, such as (3, 2, 1, 8), where the value of each component is limited to a fixed range. We propose to directly learn the discrete codes in an end-to-end neural network by applying the Gumbel-softmax trick. Experiments show the compression rate achieves 98% in a sentiment analysis task and 94% ~ 99% in machine translation tasks without performance loss. In both tasks, the proposed method can improve the model performance by slightly lowering the compression rate. Compared to other approaches such as character-level segmentation, the proposed method is language-independent and does not require modifications to the network architecture.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative neural networks have proven effective at both conditional and unconditional modeling of complex data distributions. Conditional generation enables interactive control, but creating new controls often requires expensive retraining. In this paper, we develop a method to condition generation without retraining the model. By post-hoc learning latent constraints, value functions identify regions in latent space that generate outputs with desired attributes, we can conditionally sample from these regions with gradient-based optimization or amortized actor functions. Combining attribute constraints with a universal \u201crealism\u201d constraint, which enforces similarity to the data distribution, we generate realistic conditional images from an unconditional variational autoencoder. Further, using gradient-based optimization, we demonstrate identity-preserving transformations that make the minimal adjustment in latent space to modify the attributes of an image. Finally, with discrete sequences of musical notes, we demonstrate zero-shot conditional generation, learning latent constraints in the absence of labeled data or a differentiable reward function.",

    "abstract": "The Wasserstein distance received a lot of attention recently in the community of machine learning, especially for its principled way of comparing distributions. It has found numerous applications in several hard problems, such as domain adaptation, dimensionality reduction or generative models. However, its use is still limited by a heavy computational cost. Our goal is to alleviate this problem by providing an approximation mechanism that allows to break its inherent complexity. It relies on the search of an embedding where the Euclidean distance mimics the Wasserstein distance. We show that such an embedding can be found with a siamese architecture associated with a decoder network that allows to move from the embedding space back to the original input space. Once this embedding has been found, computing optimization problems in the Wasserstein space (e.g. barycenters, principal directions or even archetypes) can be conducted extremely fast. Numerical experiments supporting this idea are conducted on image datasets, and show the wide potential benefits of our method.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks stems in large part from their ability to exploit the translation invariance that is inherent in many learning problems. Recently, it was shown that CNNs can exploit other invariances, such as rotation invariance, by using group convolutions instead of planar convolutions. However, for reasons of performance and ease of implementation, it has been necessary to limit the group convolution to transformations that can be applied to the filters without interpolation. Thus, for images with square pixels, only integer translations, rotations by multiples of 90 degrees, and reflections are admissible.\n\nWhereas the square tiling provides a 4-fold rotational symmetry, a hexagonal tiling of the plane has a 6-fold rotational symmetry. In this paper we show how one can efficiently implement planar convolution and group convolution over hexagonal lattices, by re-using existing highly optimized convolution routines. We find that, due to the reduced anisotropy of hexagonal filters, planar HexaConv provides better accuracy than planar convolution with square filters, given a fixed parameter budget. Furthermore, we find that the increased degree of symmetry of the hexagonal grid increases the effectiveness of group convolutions, by allowing for more parameter sharing. We show that our method significantly outperforms conventional CNNs on the AID aerial scene classification dataset, even outperforming ImageNet pre-trained models.",

We extensively compare our method to using Dropout and a diagonal Laplace approximation for estimating the uncertainty of a network.

For instance, video frames or audio samples which are sampled at nearby points in time tend to have similar values.  Typically, deep learning algorithms take no advantage of this redundancy to reduce computations.  This can be an obscene waste of energy.  We present a variant on backpropagation for neural networks in which computation scales with the rate of change of the data - not the rate at which we process the data.  We do this by implementing a form of Predictive Coding wherein neurons communicate a combination of their state, and their temporal change in state, and quantize this signal using Sigma-Delta modulation.  Intriguingly, this simple communication rule give rise to units that resemble biologically-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, and to a spike-timing-dependent weight-update similar to Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), a synaptic learning rule observed in the brain.  We demonstrate that on MNIST, on a temporal variant of MNIST, and on Youtube-BB, a dataset with videos in the wild, our algorithm performs about as well as a standard deep network trained with backpropagation, despite only communicating discrete values between layers.

Despite various attack approaches to crafting visually imperceptible adversarial examples, little has been developed towards a comprehensive measure of robustness. In this paper, we provide theoretical justification for converting robustness analysis into a local Lipschitz constant estimation problem, and propose to use the Extreme Value Theory for efficient evaluation. Our analysis yields a novel robustness metric called CLEVER, which is short for Cross Lipschitz Extreme Value for nEtwork Robustness. The proposed CLEVER score is attack-agnostic and is computationally feasible for large neural networks. Experimental results on various networks, including ResNet, Inception-v3 and MobileNet, show that (i) CLEVER is aligned with the robustness indication measured by the $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$ norms of adversarial examples from powerful attacks, and (ii) defended networks using defensive distillation or bounded ReLU indeed give better CLEVER scores. To the best of our knowledge, CLEVER is the first attack-independent robustness metric that can be applied to any neural network classifiers.\n\n",

However, this approach is rather restrictive in practice since collecting a large set of labeled images is very expensive. One way to ease this problem is coming up with smart ways for choosing images to be labelled from a  very large collection (i.e. active learning).\n\nOur empirical study suggests that many of the active learning heuristics in the literature are not effective when applied to CNNs when applied in batch setting. Inspired by these limitations, we define the problem of active learning as core-set selection, i.e. choosing set of points such that a model learned over the selected subset is competitive for the remaining data points. We further present a theoretical result characterizing the performance of any selected subset using the geometry of the datapoints. As an active learning algorithm, we choose the subset which is expected to yield best result according to our characterization. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in image classification experiments by a large margin.\n",

RNN can capture long-range dependency but is hard to parallelize and not time-efficient. CNN focuses on local dependency but does not perform well on some tasks. SAN can model both such dependencies via highly parallelizable computation, but memory requirement grows rapidly in line with sequence length. In this paper, we propose a model, called \"bi-directional block self-attention network (Bi-BloSAN)\", for RNN/CNN-free sequence encoding. It requires as little memory as RNN but with all the merits of SAN. Bi-BloSAN splits the entire sequence into blocks, and applies an intra-block SAN to each block for modeling local context, then applies an inter-block SAN to the outputs for all blocks to capture long-range dependency. Thus, each SAN only needs to process a short sequence, and only a small amount of memory is required. Additionally, we use feature-level attention to handle the variation of contexts around the same word, and use forward/backward masks to encode temporal order information. On nine benchmark datasets for different NLP tasks, Bi-BloSAN achieves or improves upon state-of-the-art accuracy, and shows better efficiency-memory trade-off than existing RNN/CNN/SAN. ",

However, since gradient descent is not applicable to hard-threshold functions, it is not clear how to learn them in a principled way. We address this problem by observing that setting targets for hard-threshold hidden units in order to minimize loss is a discrete optimization problem, and can be solved as such. The discrete optimization goal is to find a set of targets such that each unit, including the output, has a linearly separable problem to solve. Given these targets, the network decomposes into individual perceptrons, which can then be learned with standard convex approaches. Based on this, we develop a recursive mini-batch algorithm for learning deep hard-threshold networks that includes the popular but poorly justified straight-through estimator as a special case. Empirically, we show that our algorithm improves classification accuracy in a number of settings, including for AlexNet and ResNet-18 on ImageNet, when compared to the straight-through estimator.",

Real-world events can be stochastic and unpredictable, and the high dimensionality and complexity of natural images requires the predictive model to build an intricate understanding of the natural world. Many existing methods tackle this problem by making simplifying assumptions about the environment. One common assumption is that the outcome is deterministic and there is only one plausible future. This can lead to low-quality predictions in real-world settings with stochastic dynamics. In this paper, we develop a stochastic variational video prediction (SV2P) method that predicts a different possible future for each sample of its latent variables. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to provide effective stochastic multi-frame prediction for real-world video. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in predicting detailed future frames of videos on multiple real-world datasets, both action-free and action-conditioned. We find that our proposed method produces substantially improved video predictions when compared to the same model without stochasticity, and to other stochastic video prediction methods. Our SV2P implementation will be open sourced upon publication.",

We propose a novel learning method for deep sound recognition: Between-Class learning (BC learning). Our strategy is to learn a discriminative feature space by recognizing the between-class sounds as between-class sounds. We generate between-class sounds by mixing two sounds belonging to different classes with a random ratio. We then input the mixed sound to the model and train the model to output the mixing ratio. The advantages of BC learning are not limited only to the increase in variation of the training data; BC learning leads to an enlargement of Fisher\u2019s criterion in the feature space and a regularization of the positional relationship among the feature distributions of the classes. The experimental results show that BC learning improves the performance on various sound recognition networks, datasets, and data augmentation schemes, in which BC learning proves to be always beneficial. Furthermore, we construct a new deep sound recognition network (DSRNet) and train it with BC learning. As a result, we achieved a performance surpasses the human level.",

    "abstract": "In this work we present a new agent architecture, called Reactor, which combines multiple algorithmic and architectural contributions to produce an agent with higher sample-efficiency than Prioritized Dueling DQN (Wang et al., 2016) and Categorical DQN (Bellemare et al., 2017), while giving better run-time performance than A3C (Mnih et al., 2016). Our first contribution is a new policy evaluation algorithm called Distributional Retrace, which brings multi-step off-policy updates to the distributional reinforcement learning setting. The same approach can be used to convert several classes of multi-step policy evaluation algorithms designed for expected value evaluation into distributional ones. Next, we introduce the \u03b2-leaveone-out policy gradient algorithm which improves the trade-off between variance and bias by using action values as a baseline. Our final algorithmic contribution is a new prioritized replay algorithm for sequences, which exploits the temporal locality of neighboring observations for more efficient replay prioritization. Using the Atari 2600 benchmarks, we show that each of these innovations contribute to both the sample efficiency and final agent performance. Finally, we demonstrate that Reactor reaches state-of-the-art performance after 200 million frames and less than a day of training.",

However, the theoretical principles for designing and training ResNets are still not fully understood. Recently, several points of view have emerged to try to interpret ResNet theoretically, such as unraveled view, unrolled iterative estimation and dynamical systems view. In this paper, we adopt the dynamical systems point of view, and analyze the lesioning properties of ResNet both theoretically and experimentally.  Based on these analyses, we additionally propose a novel method for accelerating ResNet training.

We train a ``backward'' recurrent network to generate a given sequence in reverse order, and we encourage states of the forward model to predict cotemporal states of the backward model. The backward network is used only during training, and plays no role during sampling or inference. We hypothesize that our approach eases modeling of long-term dependencies by implicitly forcing the forward states to hold information about the longer-term future (as contained in the backward states).

    "abstract": "Neural text generation models are often autoregressive language models or seq2seq models. Neural autoregressive and seq2seq models that generate text by sampling words sequentially, with each word conditioned on the previous model, are state-of-the-art for several machine translation and summarization benchmarks. These benchmarks are often defined by validation perplexity even though this is not a direct measure of sample quality. Language models are typically trained via maximum likelihood and most often with teacher forcing. Teacher forcing is well-suited to optimizing perplexity but can result in poor sample quality because generating text requires conditioning on sequences of words that were never observed at training time. We propose to improve sample quality using Generative Adversarial Network (GANs), which explicitly train the generator to produce high quality samples and have shown a lot of success in image generation. GANs were originally to designed to output differentiable values, so discrete language generation is challenging for them. We introduce an actor-critic conditional GAN that fills in missing text conditioned on the surrounding context. We show qualitatively and quantitatively, evidence that this produces more realistic text samples compared to a maximum likelihood trained model.",

We propose the weight-dropped LSTM, which uses DropConnect on hidden-to-hidden weights, as a form of recurrent regularization. Further, we introduce NT-ASGD, a non-monotonically triggered  (NT) variant of the averaged stochastic gradient method (ASGD), wherein the averaging trigger is determined using a NT condition as opposed to being tuned by the user. Using these and other regularization strategies, our ASGD Weight-Dropped LSTM (AWD-LSTM) achieves state-of-the-art word level perplexities on two data sets: 57.3 on Penn Treebank and 65.8 on WikiText-2. In exploring the effectiveness of a neural cache in conjunction with our proposed model, we achieve an even lower state-of-the-art perplexity of 52.8 on Penn Treebank and 52.0 on WikiText-2. We also explore the viability of the proposed regularization and optimization strategies in the context of the quasi-recurrent neural network (QRNN) and demonstrate comparable performance to the AWD-LSTM counterpart.

    "abstract": "The graph convolutional networks (GCN) recently proposed by Kipf and Welling are an effective graph model for semi-supervised learning. Such a model, however, is transductive in nature because parameters are learned through convolutions with both training and test data. Moreover, the recursive neighborhood expansion across layers poses time and memory challenges for training with large, dense graphs. To relax the requirement of simultaneous availability of test data, we interpret graph convolutions as integral transforms of embedding functions under probability measures. Such an interpretation allows for the use of Monte Carlo approaches to consistently estimate the integrals, which in turn leads to a batched training scheme as we propose in this work---FastGCN. Enhanced with importance sampling, FastGCN not only is efficient for training but also generalizes well for inference. We show a comprehensive set of experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness compared with GCN and related models. In particular, training is orders of magnitude more efficient while predictions remain comparably accurate.\n",

The model incorporates a hyperprior to effectively capture spatial dependencies in the latent representation. This hyperprior relates to side information, a concept universal to virtually all modern image codecs, but largely unexplored in image compression using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Unlike existing autoencoder compression methods, our model trains a complex prior jointly with the underlying autoencoder. We demonstrate that this model leads to state-of-the-art image compression when measuring visual quality using the popular MS-SSIM index, and yields rate--distortion performance surpassing published ANN-based methods when evaluated using a more traditional metric based on squared error (PSNR). Furthermore, we provide a qualitative comparison of models trained for different distortion metrics.",

By structuring the neural network to statistical properties of data and applying sparsity regularization, we are able to leverage the weights to detect interactions with similar performance to the state-of-the-art without searching an exponential solution space of possible interactions. We obtain our computational savings by first observing that interactions between input features are created by the non-additive effect of nonlinear activation functions and that interacting paths are encoded in weight matrices. We use these observations to develop a way of identifying higher-order interactions with a simple traversal over the input weight matrix.  In experiments on simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate the performance of our method and the importance of discovered interactions.",

What makes them so special in the eyes of image classifiers? In this paper, we show empirically that adversarial examples mainly lie in the low probability regions of the training distribution, regardless of attack types and targeted models. Using statistical hypothesis testing, we find that modern neural density models are surprisingly good at detecting imperceptible image perturbations. Based on this discovery, we devised PixelDefend, a new approach that purifies a maliciously perturbed image by moving it back towards the distribution seen in the training data. The purified image is then run through an unmodified classifier, making our method agnostic to both the classifier and the attacking method. As a result, PixelDefend can be used to protect already deployed models and be combined with other model-specific defenses. Experiments show that our method greatly improves resilience across a wide variety of state-of-the-art attacking methods, increasing accuracy on the strongest attack from 63% to 84% for Fashion MNIST and from 32% to 70% for CIFAR-10.",

Consequently, our inability to describe these relationships has led to LSTMs being characterized as black boxes. To this end, we introduce contextual decomposition (CD), an interpretation algorithm for analysing individual predictions made by standard LSTMs, without any changes to the underlying model. By decomposing the output of a LSTM, CD captures the contributions of combinations of words or variables to the final prediction of an LSTM. On the task of sentiment analysis with the Yelp and SST data sets, we show that CD is able to reliably identify words and phrases of contrasting sentiment, and how they are combined to yield the LSTM's final prediction. Using the phrase-level labels in SST, we also demonstrate that CD is able to successfully extract positive and negative negations from an LSTM, something which has not previously been done.",

Current state-of-the-art deep generative models designed for such conditional image synthesis lack two important things: (1) they are unable to generate a large set of diverse outputs, due to the mode collapse problem. (2) they are not interpretable, making it difficult to control the synthesized output. We demonstrate that NN approaches potentially address such limitations, but suffer in accuracy on small datasets. We design a simple pipeline that combines the best of both worlds:  the first stage uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map the input to a (overly-smoothed) image, and the second stage uses a pixel-wise nearest neighbor method to map the smoothed output to multiple high-quality, high-frequency outputs in a controllable manner. Importantly, pixel-wise matching allows our method to compose novel high-frequency content by cutting-and-pasting pixels from different training exemplars.  We demonstrate our approach for various input modalities, and for various domains ranging from human faces, pets, shoes, and handbags.",

In this work, we establish a fundamental connection between the fields of quantum physics and deep learning, and use it for obtaining novel theoretical observations regarding the inductive bias of convolutional networks. Specifically, we show a structural equivalence between the function realized by a convolutional arithmetic circuit (ConvAC) and a quantum many-body wave function, which facilitates the use of quantum entanglement measures as quantifiers of a deep network's expressive ability to model correlations. Furthermore, the construction of a deep ConvAC in terms of a quantum Tensor Network is enabled. This allows us to perform a graph-theoretic analysis of a convolutional network, tying its expressiveness to a min-cut in its underlying graph. We demonstrate a practical outcome in the form of a direct control over the inductive bias via the number of channels (width) of each layer. We empirically validate our findings on standard convolutional networks which involve ReLU activations and max pooling. The description of a deep convolutional network in well-defined graph-theoretic tools and the structural connection to quantum entanglement, are two interdisciplinary bridges that are brought forth by this work.",

We formally demonstrate this hypothesis and, aiming at achieving an optimal alignment in practical cases, we adopt a more principled strategy which, differently from the current Euclidean approaches, deploys alignment along geodesics. Our pipeline can be implemented by adding to the standard classification loss (on the labeled source domain), a source-to-target regularizer that is weighted in an unsupervised and data-driven fashion. We provide extensive experiments to assess the superiority of our framework on standard domain and modality adaptation benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Human labeling of data constitutes a long and expensive process. As a consequence, many classification tasks entail incomplete annotation and incorrect labels, while being built on a restricted amount of data. In order to handle the ambiguity and the label noise, the performance of machine learning models is usually assessed with top-$k$ error metrics rather than top-$1$. Theoretical results suggest that to minimize this error, various loss functions, including cross-entropy, are equally optimal choices of learning objectives in the limit of infinite data. However, the choice of loss function becomes crucial in the context of limited and noisy data. Besides, our empirical evidence suggests that the loss function must be smooth and have non-sparse derivatives to work well with deep neural networks. Consequently, we introduce a family of smoothed loss functions that are suited to top-$k$ optimization via deep learning. The widely used cross-entropy is a special case of our family. Evaluating our smooth loss functions is computationally challenging: a na{\\\"i}ve algorithm would require $\\mathcal{O}(\\binom{C}{k})$ operations, where $C$ is the number of classes. Thanks to a connection to polynomial algebra and a divide-and-conquer approach, we provide an algorithm with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(k C)$. Furthermore, we present a novel and error-bounded approximation to obtain fast and stable algorithms on GPUs with single floating point precision. We compare the performance of the cross-entropy loss and our margin-based losses in various regimes of noise and data size, for the predominant use case of $k=5$. Our investigation reveals that our loss is more robust to noise and overfitting than cross-entropy.",

The high variance problem is particularly exasperated in problems with long horizons or high-dimensional action spaces. To mitigate this issue, we derive a bias-free action-dependent baseline for variance reduction which fully exploits the structural form of the stochastic policy itself and does not make any additional assumptions about the MDP. We demonstrate and quantify the benefit of the action-dependent baseline through both theoretical analysis as well as numerical results, including an analysis of the suboptimality of the optimal state-dependent baseline. Our experimental results indicate that action-dependent baselines allow for faster learning on standard reinforcement learning benchmarks and high dimensional hand manipulation tasks. Finally, we show that the general idea of including additional information in baselines for improved variance reduction can be extended to partially observed and multi-agent tasks.",

    "abstract": "Careful tuning of the learning rate, or even schedules thereof, can be crucial to effective neural net training. There has been much recent interest in gradient-based meta-optimization, where one tunes hyperparameters, or even learns an optimizer, in order to minimize the expected loss when the training procedure is unrolled. But because the training procedure must be unrolled thousands of times, the meta-objective must be defined with an orders-of-magnitude shorter time horizon than is typical for neural net training. We show that such short-horizon meta-objectives cause a serious bias towards small step sizes, an effect we term short-horizon bias. We introduce a toy problem, a noisy quadratic cost function, on which we analyze short-horizon bias by deriving and comparing the optimal schedules for short and long time horizons. We then run meta-optimization experiments (both offline and online) on standard benchmark datasets, showing that meta-optimization chooses too small a learning rate by multiple orders of magnitude, even when run with a moderately long time horizon (100 steps) typical of work in the area. We believe short-horizon bias is a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed if meta-optimization is to scale to practical neural net training regimes.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep learning techniques have been developed to improve the performance of program synthesis from input-output examples. Albeit its significant progress, the programs that can be synthesized by state-of-the-art approaches are still simple in terms of their complexity. In this work, we move a significant step forward along this direction by proposing a new class of challenging tasks in the domain of program synthesis from input-output examples: learning a context-free parser from pairs of input programs and their parse trees. We show that this class of tasks are much more challenging than previously studied tasks, and the test accuracy of existing approaches is almost 0%.\n\nWe tackle the challenges by developing three novel techniques inspired by three novel observations, which reveal the key ingredients of using deep learning to synthesize a complex program. First, the use of a non-differentiable machine is the key to effectively restrict the search space. Thus our proposed approach learns a neural program operating a domain-specific non-differentiable machine. Second, recursion is the key to achieve generalizability. Thus, we bake-in the notion of recursion in the design of our non-differentiable machine. Third, reinforcement learning is the key to learn how to operate the non-differentiable machine, but it is also hard to train the model effectively with existing reinforcement learning algorithms from a cold boot. We develop a novel two-phase reinforcement learning-based search algorithm to overcome this issue. In our evaluation, we show that using our novel approach, neural parsing programs can be learned to achieve 100% test accuracy on test inputs that are 500x\u0002 longer than the training samples.",

With this in mind we focus on the topological classification of reachability in a particular subset of planar graphs (Mazes). Doing so, we are able to model the topology of data while staying in Euclidean space, thus allowing its processing with standard CNN architectures. We suggest a suitable architecture for this problem and show that it can express a perfect solution to the classification task. The shape of the cost function around this solution is also derived and, remarkably, does not depend on the size of the maze in the large maze limit. Responsible for this behavior are rare events in the dataset which strongly regulate the shape of the cost function near this global minimum. We further identify an obstacle to learning in the form of poorly performing local minima in which the network chooses to ignore some of the inputs. We further support our claims with training experiments and numerical analysis of the cost function on networks with up to $128$ layers.",

Normally, the complexity of the trained agent is closely related to the complexity of the environment.  This suggests that a highly capable agent requires a complex environment for training.  In this paper, we point out that a competitive multi-agent environment trained with self-play can produce behaviors that are far more complex than the environment itself.  We also point out that such environments come with a natural curriculum, because for any skill level, an environment full of agents of this level will have the right level of difficulty.\nThis work introduces several competitive multi-agent environments where agents compete in a 3D world with simulated physics. The trained agents learn a wide variety of complex and interesting skills, even though the environment themselves are relatively simple. The skills include behaviors such as running, blocking, ducking, tackling, fooling opponents, kicking, and defending using both arms and legs.

We introduce methodology for training deep neural networks using half-precision floating point numbers, without losing model accuracy or having to modify hyper-parameters. This nearly halves memory requirements and, on recent GPUs, speeds up arithmetic. Weights, activations, and gradients are stored in IEEE half-precision format. Since this format has a narrower range than single-precision we propose three techniques for preventing the loss of critical information. Firstly, we recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of weights that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step (this copy is rounded to half-precision for the forward- and back-propagation). Secondly, we propose loss-scaling to preserve gradient values with small magnitudes. Thirdly, we use half-precision arithmetic that accumulates into single-precision outputs, which are converted to half-precision before storing to memory. We demonstrate that the proposed methodology works across a wide variety of tasks and modern large scale (exceeding 100 million parameters) model architectures, trained on large datasets.",

We show that training the student and teacher iteratively, rather than jointly, can produce interpretable teaching strategies. We evaluate interpretability by (1) measuring the similarity of the teacher's emergent strategies to intuitive strategies in each domain and (2) conducting human experiments to evaluate how effective the teacher's strategies are at teaching humans. We show that the teacher network learns to select or generate interpretable, pedagogical examples to teach rule-based, probabilistic, boolean, and hierarchical concepts.",

These exploration algorithms have been shown to allow real world robots to acquire skills such as tool use in high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. However, they have so far assumed that self-generated goals are sampled in a specifically engineered feature space, limiting their autonomy. In this work, we propose an approach using deep representation learning algorithms to learn an adequate goal space. This is a developmental 2-stage approach: first, in a perceptual learning stage, deep learning algorithms use passive raw sensor observations of world changes to learn a corresponding latent space; then goal exploration happens in a second stage by sampling goals in this latent space. We present experiments with a simulated robot arm interacting with an object, and we show that exploration algorithms using such learned representations can closely match, and even sometimes improve, the performance obtained using engineered representations.",

In addition to the mixed objective, we introduce a deep residual coattention encoder that is inspired by recent work in deep self-attention and residual networks.

However, the differences between the learned solutions of networks which generalize and those which do not remain unclear. Additionally, the tuning properties of single directions (defined as the activation of a single unit or some linear combination of units in response to some input) have been highlighted, but their importance has not been evaluated. Here, we connect these lines of inquiry to demonstrate that a network\u2019s reliance on single directions is a good predictor of its generalization performance, across networks trained on datasets with different fractions of corrupted labels, across ensembles of networks trained on datasets with unmodified labels, across different hyper- parameters, and over the course of training. While dropout only regularizes this quantity up to a point, batch normalization implicitly discourages single direction reliance, in part by decreasing the class selectivity of individual units. Finally, we find that class selectivity is a poor predictor of task importance, suggesting not only that networks which generalize well minimize their dependence on individual units by reducing their selectivity, but also that individually selective units may not be necessary for strong network performance.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, deep neural network approaches have been widely adopted for machine learning tasks, including classification. However, they were shown to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations: carefully crafted small perturbations can cause misclassification of legitimate images. We propose Defense-GAN, a new framework leveraging the expressive capability of generative models to defend deep neural networks against such attacks. Defense-GAN is trained to model the distribution of unperturbed images and, at inference time, finds a close output to a given image. This output will not contain the adversarial changes and is fed to the classifier. Our proposed method can be used with any classification model and does not modify the classifier structure or training procedure. It can also be used as a defense against any attack as it does not assume knowledge of the process for generating the adversarial examples. We empirically show that Defense-GAN is consistently effective against different attack methods and improves on existing defense strategies.",

The Dominant measure mu plays a crucial role as it defines the support on which conditional CDFs are compared. Sobolev IPM can be seen as an extension of the one dimensional Von-Mises Cramer statistics to high dimensional distributions. We show how Sobolev IPM can be used to train Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We then exploit the intrinsic conditioning implied by Sobolev IPM in text generation.

    "abstract": "Many recently trained neural networks employ a large number of parameters to achieve good performance. One may intuitively use the number of parameters required as a rough gauge  of the difficulty of a problem. % But how accurate are such notions?  How many parameters are really needed?  In this paper we attempt to  answer this question through investigating the objective landspaces constructed by the datasets and neural networks. Instead of training networks directly in the extrinsic  parameter space, we propose training in a smaller, randomly oriented  subspace. The solutions first appear, by gradually increasing the dimension of this subspace to some number, as which we define the \\emph{intrinsic dimension} of the objective landscape.  A few suggestive conclusions result. Many problems have smaller intrinsic dimensions  than one might suspect, and the intrinsic dimension for a given  dataset varies little across a family of models with vastly  different sizes. Intrinsic dimension allows some quantitative  problem comparison across supervised and reinforcement learning where we conclude, for example, that solving the  inverted pendulum problem is 100 times easier than classifying digits from MNIST.  In addition to providing new cartography of the objective landscapes wandered by parameterized models, the results encompass a simple method for constructively obtaining an upper bound on the minimum description length of a solution, leading to very compressible networks in some cases.",

    "abstract": "Neural program embeddings have shown much promise recently for a variety of program analysis tasks, including program synthesis, program repair, fault localization, etc. However, most existing program embeddings are based on syntactic features of programs, such as raw token sequences or abstract syntax trees. Unlike images and text, a program has an unambiguous semantic meaning that can be dif\ufb01cult to capture by only considering its syntax(i.e. syntactically similar programs can exhibit vastly different run-time behavior), which makes syntax-based program embeddings fundamentally limited. This paper proposes a novel semantic program embedding that is learned from program execution traces. Our key insight is that program states expressed as sequential tuples of live variable values not only captures program semantics more precisely, but also offer a more natural \ufb01t for Recurrent Neural Networks to model. We evaluate different syntactic and semantic program embeddings on predicting the types of errors that students make in their submissions to an introductory programming class and two exercises on the CodeHunt education platform. Evaluation results show that our new semantic program embedding signi\ufb01cantly outperforms the syntactic program embeddings based on token sequences and abstract syntax trees. In addition, we augment a search-based program repair system with the predictions obtained from our semantic embedding, and show that search ef\ufb01ciency is also signi\ufb01cantly improved.",

The majority of existing approaches to learning implicit models rely on approximating the intractable distribution or optimisation objective for gradient-based optimisation, which is liable to produce inaccurate updates and thus poor models. This paper alleviates the need for such approximations by proposing the \\emph{Stein gradient estimator}, which directly estimates the score function of the implicitly defined distribution. The efficacy of the proposed estimator is empirically demonstrated by examples that include meta-learning for approximate inference and entropy regularised GANs that provide improved sample diversities.",

They tend to suffer from high sample complexity, however, which hinders their use in real-world domains.  Alternatively, model-based reinforcement learning promises to reduce sample complexity, but tends to require careful tuning and to date have succeeded mainly in restrictive domains where simple models are sufficient for learning. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of vanilla model-based reinforcement learning methods when deep neural networks are used to learn both the model and the policy, and show that the learned policy tends to exploit regions where insufficient data is available for the model to be learned, causing instability in training. To overcome this issue, we propose to use an ensemble of models to maintain the model uncertainty and regularize the learning process. We further show that the use of likelihood ratio derivatives yields much more stable learning. Altogether, our approach Model-Ensemble Trust-Region Policy Optimization (ME-TRPO) significantly reduces the sample complexity compared to model-free deep RL methods on challenging continuous control benchmark tasks",

    "abstract": "We present a method for transferring neural representations from label-rich source domains to unlabeled target domains. Recent adversarial methods proposed for this task learn to align features across domains by fooling a special domain critic network. However, a drawback of this approach is that the critic simply labels the generated features as in-domain or not, without considering the boundaries between classes. This can lead to ambiguous features being generated near class boundaries, reducing target classification accuracy. We propose a novel approach, Adversarial Dropout Regularization (ADR), to encourage the generator to output more discriminative features for the target domain. Our key idea is to replace the critic with one that detects non-discriminative features, using dropout on the classifier network. The generator then learns to avoid these areas of the feature space and thus creates better features. We apply our ADR approach to the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, and demonstrate significant improvement over the state of the art. We also show that our approach can be used to train Generative Adversarial Networks for semi-supervised learning.",

Here, we propose FearNet for incremental class learning. FearNet is a generative model that does not store previous examples, making it memory efficient. FearNet uses a brain-inspired dual-memory system in which new memories are consolidated from a network for recent memories inspired by the mammalian hippocampal complex to a network for long-term storage inspired by medial prefrontal cortex. Memory consolidation is inspired by mechanisms that occur during sleep. FearNet also uses a module inspired by the basolateral amygdala for determining which memory system to use for recall.

Using an example application, namely Sea Surface Temperature Prediction, we show how general background knowledge gained from the physics could be used as a guideline for designing efficient Deep Learning models.

First, we learn an optimal transport (OT) plan, which can be thought as a one-to-many map between the two distributions. To that end, we propose a stochastic dual approach of regularized OT, and show empirically that it scales better than a recent related approach when the amount of samples is very large. Second, we estimate a Monge map as a deep neural network learned by approximating the barycentric projection of the previously-obtained OT plan. This parameterization allows generalization of the mapping outside the support of the input measure. We prove two theoretical stability results of regularized OT which show that our estimations converge to the OT and Monge map between the underlying continuous measures. We showcase our proposed approach on two applications: domain adaptation and generative modeling.",

    "abstract": "The practical successes of deep neural networks have not been matched by theoretical progress that satisfyingly explains their behavior. In this work, we study the information bottleneck (IB) theory of deep learning, which makes three specific claims: first, that deep networks undergo two distinct phases consisting of an initial fitting phase and a subsequent compression phase; second, that the compression phase is causally related to the excellent generalization performance of deep networks; and third, that the compression phase occurs due to the diffusion-like behavior of stochastic gradient descent. Here we show that none of these claims hold true in the general case. Through a combination of analytical results and simulation, we demonstrate that the information plane trajectory is predominantly a function of the neural nonlinearity employed: double-sided saturating nonlinearities like tanh yield a compression phase as neural activations enter the saturation regime, but linear activation functions and single-sided saturating nonlinearities like the widely used ReLU in fact do not. Moreover, we find that there is no evident causal connection between compression and generalization: networks that do not compress are still capable of generalization, and vice versa. Next, we show that the compression phase, when it exists, does not arise from stochasticity in training by demonstrating that we can replicate the IB findings using full batch gradient descent rather than stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we show that when an input domain consists of a subset of task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, hidden representations do compress the task-irrelevant information, although the overall information about the input may monotonically increase with training time, and that this compression happens concurrently with the fitting process rather than during a subsequent compression period.",

    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e., inputs that are almost indistinguishable from natural data and yet classified incorrectly by the network. To address this problem, we study the adversarial robustness of neural networks through the lens of robust optimization. This approach provides us with a broad and unifying view on much prior work on this topic. Its principled nature also enables us to identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a concrete security guarantee that would protect against a well-defined class of adversaries. These methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest robustness against a first-order adversary as a natural and broad security guarantee. We believe that robustness against such well-defined classes of adversaries is an important stepping stone towards fully resistant deep learning models.",

While numerous studies have been done for analyzing spatiotemporal signals, existing models have assumed that heterogeneous data sources in the spatial domain are equally reliable over time. In this paper, we propose a novel method that estimates time-varying data quality levels based on local variations of spatiotemporal signals without explicit labels that designate data quality. Furthermore, we integrate our estimate of data quality level with graph convolutional networks to exploit their efficient structure, because spatially distributed data sources form natural graphs.

    "abstract": "Existing deep multitask learning (MTL) approaches align layers shared between tasks in a parallel ordering. Such an organization significantly constricts the types of shared structure that can be learned. The necessity of parallel ordering for deep MTL is first tested by comparing it with permuted ordering of shared layers. The results indicate that a flexible ordering can enable more effective sharing, thus motivating the development of a soft ordering approach, which learns how shared layers are applied in different ways for different tasks. Deep MTL with soft ordering outperforms parallel ordering methods across a series of domains. These results suggest that the power of deep MTL comes from learning highly general building blocks that can be assembled to meet the demands of each task.",

    "abstract": "Supervised learning depends on annotated examples, which are taken to be the ground truth. But these labels often come from noisy crowdsourcing platforms, like Amazon Mechanical Turk. Practitioners typically collect multiple labels per example and aggregate the results to mitigate noise (the classic crowdsourcing problem). Given a fixed annotation budget and unlimited unlabeled data, redundant annotation comes at the expense of fewer labeled examples. This raises two fundamental questions: (1) How can we best learn from noisy workers? (2) How should we allocate our labeling budget to maximize the performance of a classifier? We propose a new algorithm for jointly modeling labels and worker quality from noisy crowd-sourced data. The alternating minimization proceeds in rounds, estimating worker quality from disagreement with the current model and then updating the model by optimizing a loss function that accounts for the current estimate of worker quality. Unlike previous approaches, even with only one annotation per example, our algorithm can estimate worker quality. We establish a generalization error bound for models learned with our algorithm and establish theoretically that it's better to label many examples once (vs less multiply) when worker quality exceeds a threshold. Experiments conducted on both ImageNet (with simulated noisy workers) and MS-COCO (using the real crowdsourced labels) confirm our algorithm's benefits. ",

The most common approaches to VQA involve either classifying answers based on fixed length representations of both the image and question or summing fractional counts estimated from each section of the image. In contrast, we treat counting as a sequential decision process and force our model to make discrete choices of what to count. Specifically, the model sequentially selects from detected objects and learns interactions between objects that influence subsequent selections. A distinction of our approach is its intuitive and interpretable output, as discrete counts are automatically grounded in the image.

    "abstract": "Predictive models that generalize well under distributional shift are often desirable and sometimes crucial to machine learning applications. One example is the estimation of treatment effects from observational data, where a subtask is to predict the effect of a treatment on subjects that are systematically different from those who received the treatment in the data. A related kind of distributional shift appears in unsupervised domain adaptation, where we are tasked with generalizing to a distribution of inputs that is different from the one in which we observe labels. We pose both of these problems as prediction under a shift in design. Popular methods for overcoming distributional shift are often heuristic or rely on assumptions that are rarely true in practice, such as having a well-specified model or knowing the policy that gave rise to the observed data. Other methods are hindered by their need for a pre-specified metric for comparing observations, or by poor asymptotic properties. In this work, we devise a bound on the generalization error under design shift, based on integral probability metrics and sample re-weighting. We combine this idea with representation learning, generalizing and tightening existing results in this space. Finally, we propose an algorithmic framework inspired by our bound and verify is effectiveness in causal effect estimation.",

Recently, Cremer et al. reinterpreted the IWAE bounds as ordinary variational evidence lower bounds (ELBO) applied to increasingly accurate variational distributions. In this work, we provide yet another perspective on the IWAE bounds. We interpret each IWAE bound as a biased estimator of the true marginal likelihood where for the bound defined on $K$ samples we show the bias to be of order O(1/K). In our theoretical analysis of the IWAE objective we derive asymptotic bias and variance expressions. Based on this analysis we develop jackknife variational inference (JVI),\na family of bias-reduced estimators reducing the bias to $O(K^{-(m+1)})$ for any given m &lt; K while retaining computational efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate that JVI leads to improved evidence estimates in variational autoencoders. We also report first results on applying JVI to learning variational autoencoders.",

On the other hand, while a lot of research has also happened in the domain of low and mixed-precision Integer training, these works either present results for non-SOTA networks (for instance only AlexNet for ImageNet-1K), or relatively small datasets (like CIFAR-10). In this work, we train state-of-the-art visual understanding neural networks on the ImageNet-1K dataset, with Integer operations on General Purpose (GP) hardware. In particular, we focus on Integer Fused-Multiply-and-Accumulate (FMA) operations which take two pairs of INT16 operands and accumulate results into an INT32 output.We propose a shared exponent representation of tensors and develop a Dynamic Fixed Point (DFP) scheme suitable for common neural network operations. The nuances of developing an efficient integer convolution kernel is examined, including methods to handle overflow of the INT32 accumulator. We implement CNN training for ResNet-50, GoogLeNet-v1, VGG-16 and AlexNet; and these networks achieve or exceed SOTA accuracy within the same number of iterations as their FP32 counterparts without any change in hyper-parameters and with a 1.8X improvement in end-to-end training throughput. To the best of our knowledge these results represent the first INT16 training results on GP hardware for ImageNet-1K dataset using SOTA CNNs and achieve highest reported accuracy using half precision ",

This has been a notable problem in training deep RL agents to perform web-based tasks, such as booking flights or replying to emails, where a single mistake can ruin the entire sequence of actions. A common remedy is to \"warm-start\" the agent by pre-training it to mimic expert demonstrations, but this is prone to overfitting. Instead, we propose to constrain exploration using demonstrations. From each demonstration, we induce high-level \"workflows\" which constrain the allowable actions at each time step to be similar to those in the demonstration (e.g., \"Step 1: click on a textbox; Step 2: enter some text\"). Our exploration policy then learns to identify successful workflows and samples actions that satisfy these workflows. Workflows prune out bad exploration directions and accelerate the agent\u2019s ability to discover rewards. We use our approach to train a novel neural policy designed to handle the semi-structured nature of websites, and evaluate on a suite of web tasks, including the recent World of Bits benchmark.

    "abstract": "Partial differential equations (PDEs)  play a prominent role in many disciplines such as applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, material science, computer science, etc. PDEs are commonly derived based on physical laws or empirical observations. However, the governing equations for many complex systems in modern applications are still not fully known. With the rapid development of sensors, computational power, and data storage in the past decade, huge quantities of data can be easily collected and efficiently stored. Such vast quantity of data offers new opportunities for data-driven discovery of hidden physical laws. Inspired by the latest development of neural network designs in deep learning, we propose a new feed-forward deep network, called PDE-Net, to fulfill two objectives at the same time: to accurately predict dynamics of complex systems and to uncover the underlying hidden PDE models. The basic idea of the proposed PDE-Net is to learn differential operators by learning convolution kernels (filters), and apply neural networks or other machine learning methods to approximate the unknown nonlinear responses. Comparing with existing approaches, which either assume the form of the nonlinear response is known or fix certain finite difference approximations of differential operators, our approach has the most flexibility by learning both differential operators and the nonlinear responses. A special feature of the proposed PDE-Net is that all filters are properly constrained, which enables us to easily identify the governing PDE models while still maintaining the expressive and predictive power of the network. These constrains are carefully designed by fully exploiting the relation between the orders of differential operators and the orders of sum rules of filters (an important concept originated from wavelet theory). We also discuss relations of the PDE-Net with some existing networks in computer vision such as Network-In-Network (NIN) and Residual Neural Network (ResNet). Numerical experiments show that the PDE-Net has the potential to uncover the hidden PDE of the observed dynamics, and predict the dynamical behavior for a relatively long time, even in a noisy environment.",

    "abstract": "Due to the success of deep learning to solving a variety of challenging machine learning tasks, there is a rising interest in understanding loss functions for training neural networks from a theoretical aspect. Particularly, the properties of critical points and the landscape around them are of importance to determine the convergence performance of optimization algorithms. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient characterization of the analytical forms for the critical points (as well as global minimizers) of the square loss functions for linear neural networks. We show that the analytical forms of the critical points characterize the values of the corresponding loss functions as well as the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve global minimum. Furthermore, we exploit the analytical forms of the critical points to characterize the landscape properties for the loss functions of linear neural networks and shallow ReLU networks. One particular conclusion is that: While the loss function of linear networks has no spurious local minimum, the loss function of one-hidden-layer nonlinear networks with ReLU activation function does have local minimum that is not global minimum.",

Bayesian hierarchical modeling provides a theoretical framework for formalizing meta-learning as inference for a set of parameters that are shared across tasks. Here, we reformulate the model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML) of Finn et al. (2017) as a method for probabilistic inference in a hierarchical Bayesian model. In contrast to prior methods for meta-learning via hierarchical Bayes, MAML is naturally applicable to complex function approximators through its use of a scalable gradient descent procedure for posterior inference. Furthermore, the identification of MAML as hierarchical Bayes provides a way to understand the algorithm\u2019s operation as a meta-learning procedure, as well as an opportunity to make use of computational strategies for efficient inference. We use this opportunity to propose an improvement to the MAML algorithm that makes use of techniques from approximate inference and curvature estimation.",

We demonstrate substantial cumulative improvements associated with each of the three aspects of our training strategy, and validate our approach on IWSLT 2016 English\u2013German and two WMT language pairs.

In this paper, we mathematically study the properties of the current variants of GANs that make use of class label information. With class aware gradient and cross-entropy decomposition, we reveal how class labels and associated losses influence GAN's training. Based on that, we propose Activation Maximization Generative Adversarial Networks (AM-GAN) as an advanced solution. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to validate our analysis and evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, where AM-GAN outperforms other strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art Inception Score (8.91) on CIFAR-10. In addition, we demonstrate that, with the Inception ImageNet classifier, Inception Score mainly tracks the diversity of the generator, and there is, however, no reliable evidence that it can reflect the true sample quality. We thus propose a new metric, called AM Score, to provide more accurate estimation on the sample quality. Our proposed model also outperforms the baseline methods in the new metric.",

    "abstract": "Adversarial neural networks solve many important problems in data science, but are notoriously difficult to train. These difficulties come from the fact that optimal weights for adversarial nets correspond to saddle points, and not minimizers, of the loss function. The alternating stochastic gradient methods typically used for such problems do not reliably converge to saddle points, and when convergence does happen it is often highly sensitive to learning rates. We propose a simple modification of stochastic gradient descent that stabilizes adversarial networks. We show, both in theory and practice, that the proposed method reliably converges to saddle points. This makes adversarial networks less likely to \"collapse,\" and enables faster training with larger learning rates.",

In traditional reinforcement learning, policies of agents are learned by MLPs which take the concatenation of all observations from the environment as input for predicting actions. In this work, we propose NerveNet to explicitly model the structure of an agent, which naturally takes the form of a graph. Specifically, serving as the agent's policy network, NerveNet first propagates information over the structure of the agent and then predict actions for different parts of the agent. In the experiments, we first show that our NerveNet is comparable to state-of-the-art methods on standard MuJoCo environments. We further propose our customized reinforcement learning environments for benchmarking two types of structure transfer learning tasks, i.e., size and disability transfer. We demonstrate that policies learned by NerveNet are significantly better than policies learned by other models and are able to transfer even in a zero-shot setting.\n",

    "abstract": "Very recently, it comes to be a popular approach for answering open-domain questions by first searching question-related passages, then applying reading comprehension models to extract answers. Existing works usually extract answers from single passages independently, thus not fully make use of the multiple searched passages, especially for the some questions requiring several evidences, which can appear in different passages, to be answered. The above observations raise the problem of evidence aggregation from multiple passages. In this paper, we deal with this problem as answer re-ranking. Specifically, based on the answer candidates generated from the existing state-of-the-art QA model, we propose two different re-ranking methods, strength-based and coverage-based re-rankers, which make use of the aggregated evidences from different passages to help entail the ground-truth answer for the question. Our model achieved state-of-the-arts on three public open-domain QA datasets, Quasar-T, SearchQA and the open-domain version of TriviaQA, with about 8\\% improvement on the former two datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Model compression is significant for the wide adoption of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in both user devices possessing limited resources and business clusters requiring quick responses to large-scale service requests. This work aims to learn structurally-sparse Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) by reducing the sizes of basic structures within LSTM units, including input updates, gates, hidden states, cell states and outputs. Independently reducing the sizes of basic structures can result in inconsistent dimensions among them, and consequently, end up with invalid LSTM units. To overcome the problem, we propose Intrinsic Sparse Structures (ISS) in LSTMs. Removing a component of ISS will simultaneously decrease the sizes of all basic structures by one and thereby always maintain the dimension consistency. By learning ISS within LSTM units, the obtained LSTMs remain regular while having much smaller basic structures. Based on group Lasso regularization, our method achieves 10.59x speedup without losing any perplexity of a language modeling of Penn TreeBank dataset. It is also successfully evaluated through a compact model with only 2.69M weights for machine Question Answering of SQuAD dataset. Our approach is successfully extended to non- LSTM RNNs, like Recurrent Highway Networks (RHNs). Our source code is available.",

    "abstract": "Do GANS (Generative Adversarial Nets) actually learn the target distribution? The foundational paper of Goodfellow et al. (2014) suggested they do, if they were given sufficiently large deep nets, sample size, and computation time. A recent theoretical analysis in Arora et al. (2017) raised doubts whether the same holds when discriminator has bounded size. It showed that the training objective can approach its optimum value even if the generated distribution has very low support. In other words, the training objective is unable to prevent mode collapse. The current paper makes two contributions. (1) It proposes a novel test for estimating support size using the birthday paradox of discrete probability. Using this  evidence is presented that well-known GANs approaches do learn distributions of fairly low support.  (2) It theoretically studies encoder-decoder GANs architectures (e.g., BiGAN/ALI), which were proposed to learn more meaningful features via GANs, and consequently to also solve the mode-collapse issue. Our result shows that such encoder-decoder training objectives also cannot guarantee learning of the full distribution because they cannot prevent serious mode collapse. More seriously, they cannot prevent learning meaningless codes for data, contrary to usual intuition.",

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), as powerful frameworks for deep generative model learning, have largely been considered as two distinct paradigms and received extensive independent studies respectively. This paper aims to establish formal connections between GANs and VAEs through a new formulation of them. We interpret sample generation in GANs as performing posterior inference, and show that GANs and VAEs involve minimizing KL divergences of respective posterior and inference distributions with opposite directions, extending the two learning phases of classic wake-sleep algorithm, respectively. The unified view provides a powerful tool to analyze a diverse set of existing model variants, and enables to transfer techniques across research lines in a principled way. For example, we apply the importance weighting method in VAE literatures for improved GAN learning, and enhance VAEs with an adversarial mechanism that leverages generated samples. Experiments show generality and effectiveness of the transfered techniques. ",

This formulation shows the connection between the standard GAN training process and the primal-dual subgradient methods for convex optimization. The inherent connection does not only provide a theoretical convergence proof for training GANs in the function space, but also inspires a novel objective function for training. The modified objective function forces the distribution of generator outputs to be updated along the direction according to the primal-dual subgradient methods. A toy example shows that the proposed method is able to resolve mode collapse, which in this case cannot be avoided by the standard GAN or Wasserstein GAN. Experiments on both Gaussian mixture synthetic data and real-world image datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on generating diverse samples.",

We propose Graph2Gauss -- an approach that can efficiently learn versatile node embeddings on large scale (attributed) graphs that show strong performance on tasks such as link prediction and node classification. Unlike most approaches that represent nodes as point vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space, we embed each node as a Gaussian distribution, allowing us to capture uncertainty about the representation. Furthermore, we propose an unsupervised method that handles inductive learning scenarios and is applicable to different types of graphs (plain/attributed, directed/undirected). By leveraging both the network structure and the associated node attributes, we are able to generalize to unseen nodes without additional training. To learn the embeddings we adopt a personalized ranking formulation w.r.t. the node distances that exploits the natural ordering of the nodes imposed by the network structure. Experiments on real world networks demonstrate the high performance of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art network embedding methods on several different tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefits of modeling uncertainty -- by analyzing it we can estimate neighborhood diversity and detect the intrinsic latent dimensionality of a graph. ",

    "abstract": "We present Compositional Attention Networks, a novel fully differentiable neural network architecture, designed to facilitate explicit and expressive reasoning. While many types of neural networks are effective at learning and generalizing from massive quantities of data, this model moves away from monolithic black-box architectures towards a design that provides a strong prior for iterative reasoning, enabling it to support explainable and structured learning, as well as generalization from a modest amount of data. The model builds on the great success of existing recurrent cells such as LSTMs: It sequences a single recurrent Memory, Attention, and Control (MAC) cell, and by careful design imposes structural constraints on the operation of each cell and the interactions between them, incorporating explicit control and soft attention mechanisms into their interfaces. We demonstrate the model's strength and robustness on the challenging CLEVR dataset for visual reasoning, achieving a new state-of-the-art 98.9% accuracy, halving the error rate of the previous best model. More importantly, we show that the new model is more computationally efficient, data-efficient, and requires an order of magnitude less time and/or data to achieve good results.",

Minimizing the loss of a deep linear neural network is a nonconvex problem, and despite recent progress, our understanding of this loss surface is still incomplete. For deep linear networks, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for a critical point of the risk function to be a global minimum. Our conditions provide an efficiently checkable test for global optimality, which is remarkable because such tests are typically intractable in nonconvex optimization. We further extend these results to deep nonlinear neural networks and prove similar sufficient conditions for global optimality, albeit in a more limited function space setting.",

    "abstract": "We propose DuoRC, a novel dataset for Reading Comprehension (RC) that motivates several new challenges for neural approaches in language understanding beyond those offered by existing RC datasets. DuoRC contains 186,089 unique question-answer pairs created from a collection of 7680 pairs of movie plots where each pair in the collection reflects two versions of the same movie - one from Wikipedia and the other from IMDb - written by two different authors. We asked crowdsourced workers to create questions from one version of the plot and a different set of workers to extract or synthesize corresponding answers from the other version. This unique characteristic of DuoRC where questions and answers are created from different versions of a document narrating the same underlying story, ensures by design, that there is very little lexical overlap between the questions created from one version and the segments containing the answer in the other version. Further, since the two versions have different level of plot detail, narration style, vocabulary, etc., answering questions from the second version requires deeper language understanding and incorporating background knowledge not available in the given text. Additionally, the narrative style of passages arising from movie plots (as opposed to typical descriptive passages in existing datasets) exhibits the need to perform complex reasoning over events across multiple sentences. Indeed, we observe that state-of-the-art neural RC models which have achieved near human performance on the SQuAD dataset, even when coupled with traditional NLP techniques to address the challenges presented in DuoRC exhibit very poor performance (F1 score of 37.42% on DuoRC v/s 86% on SQuAD dataset). This opens up several interesting research avenues wherein DuoRC could complement other Reading Comprehension style datasets to explore novel neural approaches for studying language understanding.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale distributed training requires significant communication bandwidth for gradient exchange that limits the scalability of multi-node training, and requires expensive high-bandwidth network infrastructure. The situation gets even worse with distributed training on mobile devices (federated learning), which suffers from higher latency, lower throughput, and intermittent poor connections. In this paper, we find 99.9% of the gradient exchange in distributed SGD is redundant, and propose Deep Gradient Compression (DGC) to greatly reduce the communication bandwidth. To preserve accuracy during compression, DGC employs four methods: momentum correction, local gradient clipping, momentum factor masking, and warm-up training. We have applied Deep Gradient Compression to image classification, speech recognition, and language modeling with multiple datasets including Cifar10, ImageNet, Penn Treebank, and Librispeech Corpus. On these scenarios, Deep Gradient Compression achieves a gradient compression ratio from 270x to 600x without losing accuracy, cutting the gradient size of ResNet-50 from 97MB to 0.35MB, and for DeepSpeech from 488MB to 0.74MB. Deep gradient compression enables large-scale distributed training on inexpensive commodity 1Gbps Ethernet and facilitates distributed training on mobile.",

    "abstract": " Deep neural networks have excelled on a wide range of problems, from vision to language and game playing. Neural networks very gradually incorporate information into weights as they process data, requiring very low learning rates. If the training distribution shifts, the network is slow to adapt, and when it does adapt, it typically performs badly on the training distribution before the shift. Our method, Memory-based Parameter Adaptation, stores examples in memory and then uses a context-based lookup to directly modify the weights of a neural network. Much higher learning rates can be used for this local adaptation, reneging the need for many iterations over similar data before good predictions can be made. As our method is memory-based, it alleviates several shortcomings of neural networks, such as catastrophic forgetting, fast, stable acquisition of new knowledge, learning with an imbalanced class labels, and fast learning during evaluation. We demonstrate this on a range of supervised tasks: large-scale image classification and language modelling.",

In this work, we propose a communication game where two agents, native speakers of their own respective languages, jointly learn to solve a visual referential task. We find that the ability to understand and translate a foreign language emerges as a means to achieve shared goals. The emergent translation is interactive and multimodal, and crucially does not require parallel corpora, but only monolingual, independent text and corresponding images. Our proposed translation model achieves this by grounding the source and target languages into a shared visual modality, and outperforms several baselines on both word-level and sentence-level translation tasks. Furthermore, we show that agents in a multilingual community learn to translate better and faster than in a bilingual communication setting.",

Recently, researchers have attempted to synthesize new motion by using autoregressive techniques, but existing methods tend to freeze or diverge after a couple of seconds due to an accumulation of errors that are fed back into the network. Furthermore, such methods have only been shown to be reliable for relatively simple human motions, such as walking or running. In contrast, our approach can synthesize arbitrary motions with highly complex styles, including dances or martial arts in addition to locomotion. The acRNN is able to accomplish this by explicitly accommodating for autoregressive noise accumulation during training. Our work is the first to our knowledge that demonstrates the ability to generate over 18,000 continuous frames (300 seconds) of new complex human motion w.r.t. different styles. ",

Due to the lack of paired samples and without any definition of the semantic information, the problem might seem ill-posed. Specifically, in typical cases, it seems possible to build infinitely many alternative mappings  from every target mapping. This apparent ambiguity stands in sharp contrast to the recent empirical success in solving this problem.\n\nWe identify the abstract notion of aligning two domains in a semantic way with concrete terms of minimal relative complexity. A theoretical framework for measuring the complexity of compositions of functions is developed in order to show that it is reasonable to expect the minimal complexity mapping to be unique. The measured complexity used is directly related to the depth of the neural networks being learned and a semantically aligned mapping could then be captured simply by learning using architectures that are not much bigger than the minimal architecture.\n\nVarious predictions are made based on the hypothesis that semantic alignment can be captured by the minimal mapping. These are verified extensively. In addition, a new mapping algorithm is proposed and shown to lead to better mapping results.",

Unfortunately, these techniques are significantly hindered by the fact that these generative models often produce invalid sequences: sequences which do not represent any underlying discrete structure. As a step towards solving this problem, we propose to learn a deep recurrent _validator_ model, which can estimate whether a partial sequence can function as the beginning of a full, valid sequence. This model not only discriminates between valid and invalid sequences, but also provides insight as to how individual sequence elements influence the validity of the overall sequence, and the existence of a corresponding discrete object. To learn this model we propose a reinforcement learning approach, where an oracle which can evaluate validity of complete sequences provides a sparse reward signal. We believe this is a key step toward learning generative models that faithfully produce valid sequences which represent discrete objects. We demonstrate its effectiveness in evaluating the validity of Python 3 source code for mathematical expressions, and improving the ability of a variational autoencoder trained on SMILES strings to decode valid molecular structures.",

Our\ntechnique effectively utilizes the deductive search framework to reduce the learning\nproblem of the neural component to a simple supervised learning setup. Further,\nthis allows us to both train on sparingly available real-world data and still leverage\npowerful recurrent neural network encoders. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our method by evaluating on real-world customer scenarios by synthesizing\naccurate programs with up to 12\u00d7 speed-up compared to state-of-the-art systems.",

    "abstract": "The backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) is often said to be impossible to implement in a real brain. The recent success of deep networks in machine learning and AI, however, has inspired a number of proposals for understanding how the brain might learn across multiple layers, and hence how it might implement or approximate BP. As of yet, none of these proposals have been rigorously evaluated on tasks where BP-guided deep learning has proved critical, or in architectures more structured than simple fully-connected networks. Here we present the first results on scaling up a biologically motivated model of deep learning to datasets which need deep networks with  appropriate architectures to achieve good performance. We present results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.  For CIFAR-10 we show that our algorithm, a straightforward, weight-transport-free variant of difference target-propagation (DTP) modified to remove backpropagation from the penultimate layer, is competitive with BP in training deep networks with locally defined receptive fields that have untied weights.  For ImageNet we find that both DTP and our algorithm perform significantly worse than BP, opening questions about whether different architectures or algorithms are required to scale these approaches. Our results and implementation details help establish baselines for biologically motivated deep learning schemes going forward.",

While several methods have been proposed to explain network predictions, there have been only a few attempts to compare them from a theoretical perspective.

In this work we analyze four gradient-based attribution methods and formally prove conditions of equivalence and approximation between them. By reformulating two of these methods, we construct a unified framework which enables a direct comparison, as well as an easier implementation.

Specifically, we randomly assign a pseudo parent-class label to each observation which is then modified by applying the domain specific transformation associated with the assigned label. Generated pseudo observation-label pairs are subsequently used to train a neural network with Auto-clustering Output Layer (ACOL) that introduces multiple softmax nodes for each pseudo parent-class. Due to the unsupervised objective based on Graph-based Activity Regularization (GAR) terms, softmax duplicates of each parent-class are specialized as the hidden information captured through the help of domain specific transformations is propagated during training. Ultimately we obtain a k-means friendly latent representation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the chosen transformation type impacts performance and helps propagate the latent information that is useful in revealing unknown clusters. Our results show state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised clustering tasks on MNIST, SVHN and USPS datasets, with the highest accuracies reported to date in the literature.",

We formulate it as a hierarchical conditional generative model, where memory provides a rich data-dependent prior distribution. Consequently, the top-down memory and bottom-up perception are combined to produce the code representing an observation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the adaptive memory significantly improves generative models trained on both the Omniglot and CIFAR datasets.

    "abstract": "Expressive efficiency refers to the relation between two architectures A and B, whereby any function realized by B could be replicated by A, but there exists functions realized by A, which cannot be replicated by B unless its size grows significantly larger. For example, it is known that deep networks are exponentially efficient with respect to shallow networks, in the sense that a shallow network must grow exponentially large in order to approximate the functions represented by a deep network of polynomial size. In this work, we extend the study of expressive efficiency to the attribute of network connectivity and in particular to the effect of \"overlaps\" in the convolutional process, i.e., when the stride of the convolution is smaller than its filter size (receptive field).\nTo theoretically analyze this aspect of network's design, we focus on a well-established surrogate for ConvNets called Convolutional Arithmetic Circuits (ConvACs), and then demonstrate empirically that our results hold for standard ConvNets as well. Specifically, our analysis shows that having overlapping local receptive fields, and more broadly denser connectivity, results in an exponential increase in the expressive capacity of neural networks. Moreover, while denser connectivity can increase the expressive capacity, we show that the most common types of modern architectures already exhibit exponential increase in expressivity, without relying on fully-connected layers.",

Unfortunately, due to the large number of weights, all the examples in a mini-batch typically share the same weight perturbation, thereby limiting the variance reduction effect of large mini-batches. We introduce flipout, an efficient method for decorrelating the gradients within a mini-batch by implicitly sampling pseudo-independent weight perturbations for each example. Empirically, flipout achieves the ideal linear variance reduction for fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and RNNs. We find significant speedups in training neural networks with multiplicative Gaussian perturbations. Flipout allows us to vectorize evolution strategies, so that a single GPU with flipout can handle the same throughput at least as 40 CPU cores under existing methods, equivalent to a factor-of-4 cost reduction on Amazon Web Services.",

RNNs have been widely successful in structured prediction applications such as machine translation or parsing, and are commonly trained using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Unfortunately, this training loss is not always an appropriate surrogate for the test error: by only maximizing the ground truth probability, it fails to exploit the wealth of information offered by structured losses. Further, it introduces discrepancies between training and predicting (such as exposure bias) that may hurt test performance. Instead, SEARNN leverages test-alike search space exploration to introduce global-local losses that are closer to the test error. We first demonstrate improved performance over MLE on two different tasks: OCR and spelling correction. Then, we propose a subsampling strategy to enable SEARNN to scale to large vocabulary sizes. This allows us to validate the benefits of our approach on a machine translation task.",

Specifically, we study applying image transformations such as bit-depth reduction, JPEG compression, total variance minimization, and image quilting before feeding the image to a convolutional network classifier. Our experiments on ImageNet show that total variance minimization and image quilting are very effective defenses in practice, in particular, when the network is trained on transformed images. The strength of those defenses lies in their non-differentiable nature and their inherent randomness, which makes it difficult for an adversary to circumvent the defenses. Our best defense eliminates 60% of strong gray-box and 90% of strong black-box attacks by a variety of major attack methods.",

    "abstract": "Low-dimensional vector embeddings, computed using LSTMs or simpler techniques, are a popular approach for capturing the \u201cmeaning\u201d of text and a form of unsupervised learning useful for downstream tasks. However, their power is not theoretically understood. The current paper derives formal understanding by looking at the subcase of linear embedding schemes. Using the theory of compressed sensing we show that representations combining the constituent word vectors are essentially information-preserving linear measurements of Bag-of-n-Grams (BonG) representations of text. This leads to a new theoretical result about LSTMs: low-dimensional embeddings derived from a low-memory LSTM are provably at least as powerful on classification tasks, up to small error, as a linear classifier over BonG vectors, a result that extensive empirical work has thus far been unable to show. Our experiments support these theoretical findings and establish strong, simple, and unsupervised baselines on standard benchmarks that in some cases are state of the art among word-level methods. We also show a surprising new property of word embeddings such as GloVe and word2vec: they form a good sensing matrix for text that is more efficient than random matrices, a standard sparse recovery tool, which may explain why they lead to better representations in practice.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have enjoyed great success, however often suffer instability during training which motivates many attempts to resolve this issue. Theoretical explanation for the cause of instability is provided in Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), and wasserstein distance is proposed to stablize the training. Though WGAN is indeed more stable than previous GANs, it takes much more iterations and time to train. This is because the ways to ensure Lipschitz condition in WGAN (such as weight-clipping) significantly limit the capacity of the network. In this paper, we argue that it is beneficial to ensure Lipschitz condition as well as maintain sufficient capacity and expressiveness of the network. To facilitate this, we develop both theoretical and practical building blocks, using which one can construct different neural networks using a large range of metrics, as well as ensure Lipschitz condition and sufficient capacity of the networks. Using the proposed building blocks, and a special choice of a metric called Dudley metric, we propose Dudley GAN that outperforms the state of the arts in both convergence and sample quality. We discover a natural link between Dudley GAN (and its extension) and empirical risk minimization, which gives rise to generalization analysis.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely believed to perform implicit regularization when used to train deep neural networks, but the precise manner in which this occurs has thus far been elusive. We prove that SGD minimizes an average potential over the posterior distribution of weights along with an entropic regularization term. This potential is however not the original loss function in general. So SGD does perform variational inference, but for a different loss than the one used to compute the gradients. Even more surprisingly, SGD does not even converge in the classical sense: we show that the most likely trajectories of SGD for deep networks do not behave like Brownian motion around critical points. Instead, they resemble closed loops with deterministic components. We prove that such out-of-equilibrium behavior is a consequence of highly non-isotropic gradient noise in SGD; the covariance matrix of mini-batch gradients for deep networks has a rank as small as 1% of its dimension. We provide extensive empirical validation of these claims, proven in the appendix.",

    "abstract": "One of the long-standing challenges in Artificial Intelligence for learning goal-directed behavior is to build a single agent which can solve multiple tasks. Recent progress in multi-task learning for goal-directed sequential problems has been in the form of distillation based learning wherein a student network learns from multiple task-specific expert networks by mimicking the task-specific policies of the expert networks. While such approaches offer a promising solution to the multi-task learning problem, they require supervision from large expert networks which require extensive data and computation time for training.\nIn this work, we propose an efficient multi-task learning framework which solves multiple goal-directed tasks in an on-line setup without the need for expert supervision. Our work uses active learning principles to achieve multi-task learning by sampling the harder tasks more than the easier ones. We propose three distinct models under our active sampling framework. An adaptive method with extremely competitive multi-tasking performance. A UCB-based meta-learner which casts the problem of picking the next task to train on as a multi-armed bandit problem. A meta-learning method that casts the next-task picking problem as a full Reinforcement Learning problem and uses actor-critic methods for optimizing the multi-tasking performance directly. We demonstrate results in the Atari 2600 domain on seven multi-tasking instances: three 6-task instances, one 8-task instance, two 12-task instances and one 21-task instance.",

Network regularization techniques typically focus on convolutional layer operations, while leaving pooling layer operations without suitable options. We introduce Wavelet Pooling as another alternative to traditional neighborhood pooling. This method decomposes features into a second level decomposition, and discards the first-level subbands to reduce feature dimensions. This method addresses the overfitting problem encountered by max pooling, while reducing features in a more structurally compact manner than pooling via neighborhood regions.

Activation maps, however, occupy a large memory footprint during both the training and inference step when using mini-batches of inputs. One way to reduce this large memory footprint is to reduce the precision of activations. However, past works have shown that reducing the precision of activations hurts model accuracy. We study schemes to train networks from scratch using reduced-precision activations without hurting accuracy. We reduce the precision of activation maps (along with model parameters) and increase the number of filter maps in a layer, and find that this scheme matches or surpasses the accuracy of the baseline full-precision network. As a result, one can significantly improve the execution efficiency (e.g. reduce dynamic memory footprint, memory band- width and computational energy) and speed up the training and inference process with appropriate hardware support. We call our scheme WRPN -- wide reduced-precision networks. We report results and show that WRPN scheme is better than previously reported accuracies on ILSVRC-12 dataset while being computationally less expensive compared to previously reported reduced-precision networks.",

    "abstract": "Recently popularized graph neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning, improving significantly over existing approaches. These architectures alternate between a propagation layer that aggregates the hidden states of the local neighborhood and a fully-connected layer. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that a linear model, that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, is still able to achieve a performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. This significantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for semi-supervised learning where number of labeled examples are small. This in turn allows a room for designing more innovative propagation layers. Based on this insight, we propose a novel graph neural network that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, and replaces the propagation layers with attention mechanisms that respect the structure of the graph. The attention mechanism allows us to learn a dynamic and adaptive local summary of the neighborhood to achieve more accurate predictions. In a number of experiments on benchmark citation networks datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing methods. By examining the attention weights among neighbors, we show that our model provides some interesting insights on how neighbors influence each other.",

    "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a family of generative models that do not minimize a single training criterion. Unlike other generative models, the data distribution is learned via a game between a generator (the generative model) and a discriminator (a teacher providing training signal) that each minimize their own cost. GANs are designed to reach a Nash equilibrium at which each player cannot reduce their cost without changing the other players\u2019 parameters. One useful approach for the theory of GANs is to show that a divergence between the training distribution and the model distribution obtains its minimum value at equilibrium. Several recent research directions have been motivated by the idea that this divergence is the primary guide for the learning process and that every step of learning should decrease the divergence. We show that this view is overly restrictive. During GAN training, the discriminator provides learning signal in situations where the gradients of the divergences between distributions would not be useful. We provide empirical counterexamples to the view of GAN training as divergence minimization. Specifically, we demonstrate that GANs are able to learn distributions in situations where the divergence minimization point of view predicts they would fail. We also show that gradient penalties motivated from the divergence minimization perspective are equally helpful when applied in other contexts in which the divergence minimization perspective does not predict they would be helpful. This contributes to a growing body of evidence that GAN training may be more usefully viewed as approaching Nash equilibria via trajectories that do not necessarily minimize a specific divergence at each step.",

Hence, both environment and task specific knowledge are entangled into one framework. However, there are often scenarios where the environment (e.g. the physical world) is fixed while only the target task changes. Hence, borrowing the idea from hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a framework that disentangles task and environment specific knowledge by separating them into two units. The environment-specific unit handles how to move from one state to the target state; and the task-specific unit plans for the next target state given a specific task.

    "abstract": "We propose a practical method for $L_0$ norm regularization for neural networks: pruning the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero. Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. AIC and BIC, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of $L_0$ regularization. However, since the $L_0$ norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected $L_0$ regularized objective is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the \\emph{hard concrete} distribution for the gates, which is obtained by ``stretching'' a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.",

However, these malicious perturbations are often unnatural, not semantically meaningful, and not applicable to complicated domains such as language. In this paper, we propose a framework to generate natural and legible adversarial examples by searching in semantic space of dense and continuous data representation, utilizing the recent advances in generative adversarial networks. We present generated adversaries to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for black-box classifiers in a wide range of applications such as image classification, textual entailment, and machine translation.

We further evaluate these language models in terms of their ability to capture non-local syntactic dependencies on a subject-verb agreement dataset  (Linzen et al., 2016) and establish new state of the art results using memory augmented language models. Our results demonstrate the value of stack-structured memory for explaining the distribution of words in natural language, in line with linguistic theories claiming a context-free backbone for natural language.",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of machine learning has increased concerns about the privacy\nimplications of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, such as medical\nrecords or other personal information. To address those concerns, one promising\napproach is Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles, or PATE, which transfers\nto a \u201cstudent\u201d model the knowledge of an ensemble of \u201cteacher\u201d models, with\nintuitive privacy provided by training teachers on disjoint data and strong privacy\nguaranteed by noisy aggregation of teachers\u2019 answers. However, PATE has so far\nbeen evaluated only on simple classification tasks like MNIST, leaving unclear its\nutility when applied to larger-scale learning tasks and real-world datasets.\n\nIn this work, we show how PATE can scale to learning tasks with large numbers\nof output classes and uncurated, imbalanced training data with errors. For this, we\nintroduce new noisy aggregation mechanisms for teacher ensembles that are more\nselective and add less noise, and prove their tighter differential-privacy guarantees.\nOur new mechanisms build on two insights: the chance of teacher consensus is\nincreased by using more concentrated noise and, lacking consensus, no answer\nneed be given to a student. The consensus answers used are more likely to be\ncorrect, offer better intuitive privacy, and incur lower-differential privacy cost. Our\nevaluation show our mechanisms to improve on the original PATE on all measures,\nand scale to larger tasks with both high utility and very strong privacy (\u03b5 \u2248 1.0).",

    "abstract": "Recent AI research has emphasized the importance of learning  disentangled representations of the explanatory factors behind data. Despite the growing interest in models which can learn such representations, visual inspection remains the standard evaluation metric.  While various desiderata have been implied in recent definitions, it is currently unclear what exactly makes one disentangled representation better than another. In this work we propose a framework for the quantitative evaluation of disentangled representations when the ground-truth latent structure is available. Three criteria are explicitly defined and quantified to elucidate the quality of learnt representations and thus compare models on an equal basis. To illustrate the appropriateness of the framework, we employ it to compare quantitatively the representations learned by a state-of-the-art model (InfoGAN) and those learned by a baseline model (PCA).",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated their powerful ability on various tasks in recent years. However, they are extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples. I.e., clean images, with imperceptible perturbations added, can easily cause convolutional neural networks to fail. In this paper, we propose to utilize randomization to mitigate adversarial effects. Specifically, we use two randomization operations: random resizing, which resizes the input images to a random size, and random padding, which pads zeros around the input images in a random manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed randomization method is very effective at defending against both single-step and iterative attacks. Our method also enjoys the following advantages: 1) no additional training or fine-tuning, 2) very few additional computations, 3) compatible with other adversarial defense methods. By combining the proposed randomization method with an adversarially trained model, it get a normalized score of 0.924 (ranked Top 2 among 107 defense models) in a public challenge on defending against adversarial examples, which is far better than using adversarial training alone with a normalized score of 0.773.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has yielded state-of-the-art performance on many natural language processing tasks including named entity recognition (NER). However, this typically requires large amounts of labeled data. In this work, we demonstrate that the amount of labeled training data can be drastically reduced when deep learning is combined with active learning. While active learning is sample-efficient, it can be computationally expensive since it requires iterative retraining. To speed this up, we introduce a lightweight architecture for NER, viz., the CNN-CNN-LSTM model consisting of convolutional character and word encoders and a  long short term memory (LSTM) tag decoder. The model achieves nearly state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for the task while being computationally much more efficient than best performing models. We carry out incremental active learning, during the training process, and are able to nearly match state-of-the-art performance with just 25\\% of the original training data.",

The importance of AL has motivated extensive research, proposing a wide variety of manually designed AL algorithms with diverse theoretical and intuitive motivations. In contrast to this body of research, we propose to treat active learning algorithm design as a meta-learning problem and learn the best criterion from data. We model an active learning algorithm as a deep neural network that inputs the base learner state and the unlabelled point set and predicts the best point to annotate next. Training this active query policy network with reinforcement learning, produces the best non-myopic policy for a given dataset. The key challenge in achieving a general solution to AL then becomes that of learner generalisation, particularly across heterogeneous datasets. We propose a multi-task dataset-embedding approach that allows dataset-agnostic active learners to be trained. Our evaluation shows that AL algorithms trained in this way can directly generalize across diverse problems.",

The setup is as follows: given an episodic task and a finite number of off-policy RL algorithms, a meta-algorithm has to decide which RL algorithm is in control during the next episode so as to maximize the expected return. The article presents a novel meta-algorithm, called Epochal Stochastic Bandit Algorithm Selection (ESBAS). Its principle is to freeze the policy updates at each epoch, and to leave a rebooted stochastic bandit in charge of the algorithm selection. Under some assumptions, a thorough theoretical analysis demonstrates its near-optimality considering the structural sampling budget limitations. ESBAS is first empirically evaluated on a dialogue task where it is shown to outperform each individual algorithm in most configurations. ESBAS is then adapted to a true online setting where algorithms update their policies after each transition, which we call SSBAS. SSBAS is evaluated on a fruit collection task where it is shown to adapt the stepsize parameter more efficiently than the classical hyperbolic decay, and on an Atari game, where it improves the performance by a wide margin.",

However, existing approaches largely ignore this coupling, instead choosing to alternate between separate design and control phases, which requires expert intuition throughout and risks convergence to suboptimal designs. In this work, we propose a method that jointly optimizes over the physical design of a robot and the corresponding control policy in a model-free fashion, without any need for expert supervision. Given an arbitrary robot morphology, our method maintains a distribution over the design parameters and uses reinforcement learning to train a neural network controller. Throughout training, we refine the robot distribution to maximize the expected reward. This results in an assignment to the robot parameters and neural network policy that are jointly optimal. We evaluate our approach in the context of legged locomotion, and demonstrate that it discovers novel robot designs and walking gaits for several different morphologies, achieving performance comparable to or better than that of hand-crafted designs.",

    "abstract": "We propose an approach to address two undesired properties of unsupervised GANs. First, since GANs use only a continuous latent distribution to embed multiple classes or clusters of a dataset, GANs often do not correctly handle the structural discontinuity between disparate classes in a latent space. Second, discriminators of GANs easily forget about past generated samples by generators, incurring instability during adversarial training. We argue that these two infamous problems of unsupervised GANs can be largely alleviated by a memory structure to which both generators and discriminators can access. Generators can effectively store a large amount of training samples that are needed to understand the underlying cluster distribution, which eases the structure discontinuity problem. At the same time, discriminators can memorize previously generated samples, which mitigate the forgetting problem. We propose a novel end-to-end GAN model named memoryGAN, that involves a memory network that can be trained in an unsupervised manner, and integrable to many existing models of GANs. With evaluations on multiple datasets including Fashion-MNIST, CelebA, CIFAR10, and Chairs, we show that our model is probabilistically interpretable, and generates image samples of high visual fidelity. We also show that our memoryGAN also achieves the state-of-the-art inception scores among unsupervised GAN models on the CIFAR10 dataset, without additional tricks or weaker divergences.",

The agent sees images of the surrounding environment, listens to a virtual teacher, and takes actions to receive rewards. It interactively learns the teacher\u2019s language from scratch based on two language use cases: sentence-directed navigation and question answering. It learns simultaneously the visual representations of the world, the language, and the action control. By disentangling language grounding from other computational routines and sharing a concept detection function between language grounding and prediction, the agent reliably interpolates and extrapolates to interpret sentences that contain new word combinations or new words missing from training sentences. The new words are transferred from the answers of language prediction. Such a language ability is trained and evaluated on a population of over 1.6 million distinct sentences consisting of 119 object words, 8 color words, 9 spatial-relation words, and 50 grammatical words. The proposed model significantly outperforms five comparison methods for interpreting zero-shot sentences. In addition, we demonstrate human-interpretable intermediate outputs of the model in the appendix.",

We apply a perturbation theory on residual networks and decouple the interactions between residual units. The resulting warp operator is a first order approximation of the output over multiple layers. The first order perturbation theory exhibits properties such as binomial path lengths and exponential gradient scaling found experimentally by Veit et al (2016). \nWe demonstrate through an extensive performance study that the proposed network achieves comparable predictive performance to the original residual network with the same number of parameters, while achieving a significant speed-up on the total training time. As WarpNet performs model parallelism in residual network training in which weights are distributed over different GPUs, it offers speed-up and capability to train larger networks compared to original residual networks.",

    "abstract": "The development of high-dimensional generative models has recently gained a great surge of interest with the introduction of variational auto-encoders and generative adversarial neural networks. Different variants have been proposed where the underlying latent space is structured, for example, based on attributes describing the data to generate. We focus on a particular problem where one aims at generating samples corresponding to a number of objects under various views. We assume that the distribution of the data is driven by two independent latent factors: the content, which represents the intrinsic features of an object, and the view, which stands for the settings of a particular observation of that object. Therefore, we propose a generative model and a conditional variant built on such a disentangled latent space. This approach allows us to generate realistic samples corresponding to various objects in a high variety of views. Unlike many multi-view approaches, our model doesn't need any supervision on the views but only on the content. Compared to other conditional generation approaches that are mostly based on binary or categorical attributes, we make no such assumption about the factors of variations. Our model can be used on problems with a huge, potentially infinite, number of categories. We experiment it on four images datasets on which we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and its ability to generalize. ",

Unlike other systems, our solution is able to deal with unconstrained voice samples and without requiring aligned phonemes or linguistic features. The network architecture is simpler than those in the existing literature and is based on a novel shifting buffer working memory. The same buffer is used for estimating the attention, computing the output audio, and for updating the buffer itself. The input sentence is encoded using a context-free lookup table that contains one entry per character or phoneme. The speakers are similarly represented by a short vector that can also be fitted to new identities, even with only a few samples. Variability in the generated speech is achieved by priming the buffer prior to generating the audio. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate convincing capabilities, making TTS accessible to a wider range of applications. In order to promote reproducibility, we release our source code and models.",

We shed light on this by proving that the total number of neurons m required to approximate natural classes of multivariate polynomials of n variables grows only linearly with n for deep neural networks, but grows exponentially when merely a single hidden layer is allowed. We also provide evidence that when the number of hidden layers is increased from 1 to k, the neuron requirement grows exponentially not with n but with n^{1/k}, suggesting that the minimum number of layers required for practical expressibility grows only logarithmically with n.",

In practice, this means that by fixing the identity portion of latent codes, we can generate diverse images of the same subject, and by fixing the observation portion we can traverse the manifold of subjects while maintaining contingent aspects such as lighting and pose. Our algorithm features a pairwise training scheme in which each sample from the generator consists of two images with a common identity code. Corresponding samples from the real dataset consist of two distinct photographs of the same subject. In order to fool the discriminator, the generator must produce images that are both photorealistic, distinct, and appear to depict the same person.

By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples.  Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures.

However, recent work on recurrent neural networks and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. Despite their attractive properties and potential for opening up entirely new neural architectures, complex-valued deep neural networks have been marginalized due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models. In this work, we provide the key atomic components for complex-valued deep neural networks and apply them to convolutional feed-forward networks. More precisely, we rely on complex convolutions and present algorithms for complex batch-normalization, complex weight initialization strategies for complex-valued neural nets and we use them in experiments with end-to-end training schemes. We demonstrate that such complex-valued models are competitive with their real-valued counterparts. We test deep complex models on several computer vision tasks, on music transcription using the MusicNet dataset and on Speech spectrum prediction using TIMIT.

    "abstract": "Multiagent systems where the agents interact among themselves and with an stochastic environment can be formalized as stochastic games. We study a subclass of these games, named Markov potential games (MPGs), that appear often in economic and engineering applications when the agents share some common resource. We consider MPGs with continuous state-action variables, coupled constraints and nonconvex rewards. Previous analysis followed a variational approach that is only valid for very simple cases (convex rewards, invertible dynamics, and no coupled constraints); or considered deterministic dynamics and provided open-loop (OL) analysis, studying strategies that consist in predefined action sequences, which are not optimal for stochastic environments. We present a closed-loop (CL) analysis for MPGs and consider parametric policies that depend on the current state and where agents adapt to stochastic transitions. We provide easily verifiable, sufficient and necessary conditions for a stochastic game to be an MPG, even for complex parametric functions (e.g., deep neural networks); and show that a closed-loop Nash equilibrium (NE) can be found (or at least approximated) by solving a related optimal control problem (OCP). This is useful since solving an OCP---which is a single-objective problem---is usually much simpler than solving the original set of coupled OCPs that form the game---which is a multiobjective control problem. This is a considerable improvement over the previously standard approach for the CL analysis of MPGs, which gives no approximate solution if no NE belongs to the chosen parametric family, and which is practical only for simple parametric forms. We illustrate the theoretical contributions with an example by applying our approach to a noncooperative communications engineering game. We then solve the game with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that learns policies that closely approximates an exact variational NE of the game.",

Once a person learns the meaning of a new verb \"dax,\" he or she can immediately understand the meaning of \"dax twice\" or \"sing and dax.\" In this paper, we introduce the SCAN domain, consisting of a set of simple compositional navigation commands paired with the corresponding action sequences. We then test the zero-shot generalization capabilities of a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on SCAN with sequence-to-sequence methods. We find that RNNs can generalize well when the differences between training and test commands are small, so that they can apply \"mix-and-match\" strategies to solve the task. However, when generalization requires systematic compositional skills (as in the \"dax\" example above), RNNs fail spectacularly. We conclude with a proof-of-concept experiment in neural machine translation, supporting the conjecture that lack of systematicity is an important factor explaining why neural networks need very large training sets.",

This procedure is successful for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), SGD with momentum, Nesterov momentum, and Adam. It reaches equivalent test accuracies after the same number of training epochs, but with fewer parameter updates, leading to greater parallelism and shorter training times. We can further reduce the number of parameter updates by increasing the learning rate $\\epsilon$ and scaling the batch size $B \\propto \\epsilon$. Finally, one can increase the momentum coefficient $m$ and scale $B \\propto 1/(1-m)$, although this tends to slightly reduce the test accuracy. Crucially, our techniques allow us to repurpose existing training schedules for large batch training with no hyper-parameter tuning. We train Inception-ResNet-V2 on ImageNet to $77\\%$ validation accuracy in under 2500 parameter updates, efficiently utilizing training batches of 65536 images.",

In this paper, we show how 1) neural attention and 2) meta learning techniques can be used in combination with autoregressive models to enable effective few-shot density estimation. Our proposed modifications to PixelCNN result in state-of-the art few-shot density estimation on the Omniglot dataset.

    "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the family of functions representable by deep neural networks (DNN) with rectified linear units (ReLU). We give an algorithm to train a ReLU DNN with one hidden layer to {\\em global optimality} with runtime polynomial in the data size albeit exponential in the input dimension. Further, we improve on the known lower bounds on size (from exponential to super exponential) for approximating a ReLU deep net function by a shallower ReLU net. Our gap theorems hold for smoothly parametrized families of ``hard'' functions, contrary to countable, discrete families known in the literature.  An example consequence of our gap theorems is the following: for every natural number $k$ there exists a function representable by a ReLU DNN with $k^2$ hidden layers and total size $k^3$, such that any ReLU DNN with at most $k$ hidden layers will require at least $\\frac12k^{k+1}-1$ total nodes. Finally, we construct a family of $\\R^n\\to \\R$ piecewise linear functions for $n\\geq 2$ (also smoothly parameterized), whose number of affine pieces scales exponentially with the dimension $n$ at any fixed size and depth. To the best of our knowledge, such a construction with exponential dependence on $n$ has not been achieved by previous families of ``hard'' functions in the neural nets literature. This construction utilizes the theory of zonotopes from polyhedral theory.",

    "abstract": "The problem of detecting whether a test sample is from in-distribution (i.e., training distribution by a classifier) or out-of-distribution sufficiently different from it arises in many real-world machine learning applications. However, the state-of-art deep neural networks are known to be highly overconfident in their predictions, i.e., do not distinguish in- and out-of-distributions. Recently, to handle this issue, several threshold-based detectors have been proposed given pre-trained neural classifiers. However, the performance of prior works highly depends on how to train the classifiers since they only focus on improving inference procedures. In this paper, we develop a novel training method for classifiers so that such inference algorithms can work better. In particular, we suggest two additional terms added to the original loss (e.g., cross entropy). The first one forces samples from out-of-distribution less confident by the classifier and the second one is for (implicitly) generating most effective training samples for the first one. In essence, our method jointly trains both classification and generative neural networks for out-of-distribution. We demonstrate its effectiveness using deep convolutional neural networks on various popular image datasets.",

For applications running on limited hardware, however, high precision real-time processing can still be a challenge.  One approach to solving this problem is training networks with binary or ternary weights, thus removing the need to calculate multiplications and significantly reducing memory size. In this work, we introduce LR-nets (Local reparameterization networks), a new method for training neural networks with discrete weights using stochastic parameters. We show how a simple modification to the local reparameterization trick, previously used to train Gaussian distributed weights, enables the training of discrete weights.

SRU is as fast as a convolutional layer and 5-10x faster than an optimized LSTM implementation.

Recently, convolutional sequence-to-sequence networks have been applied to machine translation tasks with good results. In this work, we study how depthwise separable convolutions can be applied to neural machine translation. We introduce a new architecture inspired by Xception and ByteNet, called SliceNet, which enables a significant reduction of the parameter count and amount of computation needed to obtain results like ByteNet, and, with a similar parameter count, achieves better results.\nIn addition to showing that depthwise separable convolutions perform well for machine translation, we investigate the architectural changes that they enable: we observe that thanks to depthwise separability, we can increase the length of convolution windows, removing the need for filter dilation. We also introduce a new super-separable convolution operation that further reduces the number of parameters and computational cost of the models.",

This work shows that such attributes of neural networks can be exposed from a sequence of queries. This has multiple implications. On the one hand, our work exposes the vulnerability of black-box neural networks to different types of attacks -- we show that the revealed internal information helps generate more effective adversarial examples against the black box model. On the other hand, this technique can be used for better protection of private content from automatic recognition models using adversarial examples.

Two key challenges are how to focus exploration on more valuable states, and how to direct exploration toward gaining new world knowledge. Visit-counters have been proven useful both in practice and in theory for directed exploration. However, a major limitation of counters is their locality, considering only the immediate one step exploration value. While there are a few model-based solutions to this difficulty, a model-free approach is still missing. We propose $E$-values, a generalization of counters that can be used to evaluate the propagating exploratory value over state-action trajectories. We compare our approach to commonly used RL techniques, and show that using $E$-value improves learning and performance over traditional counters.

Conventional sparse matrix formats, however, involve irregular index structures with large storage requirement and sequential reconstruction process, resulting in inefficient use of highly parallel computing resources. Hence, pruning is usually restricted to inference with a batch size of one, for which an efficient parallel matrix-vector multiplication method exists. In this paper, a new class of sparse matrix representation utilizing Viterbi algorithm that has a high, and more importantly, fixed index compression ratio regardless of the pruning rate, is proposed. In this approach, numerous sparse matrix candidates are first generated by the Viterbi encoder, and then the one that aims to minimize the model accuracy degradation is selected by the Viterbi algorithm. The model pruning process based on the proposed Viterbi encoder and Viterbi algorithm is highly parallelizable, and can be implemented efficiently in hardware to achieve low-energy, high-performance index decoding process. Compared with the existing magnitude-based pruning methods, index data storage requirement can be further compressed by 85.2% in MNIST and 83.9% in AlexNet while achieving similar pruning rate. Even compared with the relative index compression technique, our method can still reduce the index storage requirement by 52.7% in MNIST and 35.5% in AlexNet.",

It is based on an approximation to the Fisher information matrix (FIM) that makes assumptions about the particular structure of the network and the way it is parameterized. The original K-FAC method was applicable only to fully-connected networks, although it has been recently extended by Grosse &amp; Martens (2016) to handle convolutional networks as well. In this work we extend the method to handle RNNs by introducing a novel approximation to the FIM for RNNs. This approximation works by modelling the covariance structure between the gradient contributions at different time-steps using a chain-structured linear Gaussian graphical model, summing the various cross-covariances, and computing the inverse in closed form. We demonstrate in experiments that our method significantly outperforms general purpose state-of-the-art optimizers like SGD with momentum and Adam on several challenging RNN training tasks.",

In this work, we show that we can build a bilingual dictionary between two languages without using any parallel corpora, by aligning monolingual word embedding spaces in an unsupervised way. Without using any character information, our model even outperforms existing supervised methods on cross-lingual tasks for some language pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that our method works very well also for distant language pairs, like English-Russian or English-Chinese.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral skills, but real-world application of these methods requires a considerable amount of experience to be collected by the agent. In practical settings, such as robotics, this involves repeatedly attempting a task, resetting the environment between each attempt. However, not all tasks are easily or automatically reversible. In practice, this learning process requires considerable human intervention. In this work, we propose an autonomous method for safe and efficient reinforcement learning that simultaneously learns a forward and backward policy, with the backward policy resetting the environment for a subsequent attempt. By learning a value function for the backward policy, we can automatically determine when the forward policy is about to enter a non-reversible state, providing for uncertainty-aware safety aborts. Our experiments illustrate that proper use of the backward policy can greatly reduce the number of manual resets required to learn a task and can reduce the number of unsafe actions that lead to non-reversible states.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic hardware tends to pose limits on the connectivity of deep networks that one can run on them. But also generic hardware and software implementations of deep learning run more efficiently for sparse networks. Several methods exist for pruning connections of a neural network after it was trained without connectivity constraints. We present an algorithm, DEEP R, that enables us to train directly a sparsely connected neural network. DEEP R automatically rewires the network during supervised training so that connections are there where they are most needed for the task, while its total number is all the time strictly bounded. We demonstrate that DEEP R can be used to train very sparse feedforward and recurrent neural networks on standard benchmark tasks with just a minor loss in performance. DEEP R is based on a rigorous theoretical foundation that views rewiring as stochastic sampling of network configurations from a posterior.",

In this paper, we present a semi-supervised technique that addresses both these issues simultaneously. We learn dense representations from large unlabelled image datasets, then use those representations to both learn classifiers from small labeled sets and generate visual rationales explaining the predictions. Using chest radiography diagnosis as a motivating application, we show our method has good generalization ability by learning to represent our chest radiography dataset while training a classifier on an separate set from a different institution. Our method identifies heart failure and other thoracic diseases. For each prediction, we generate visual rationales for positive classifications by optimizing a latent representation to minimize the probability of disease while constrained by a similarity measure in image space. Decoding the resultant latent representation produces an image without apparent disease. The difference between the original and the altered image forms an interpretable visual rationale for the algorithm's prediction. Our method simultaneously produces visual rationales that compare favourably to previous techniques and a classifier that outperforms the current state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Techniques such as ensembling and distillation promise model quality improvements when paired with almost any base model. However, due to increased test-time cost (for ensembles) and increased complexity of the training pipeline (for distillation), these techniques are challenging to use in industrial settings. In this paper we explore a variant of distillation which is relatively straightforward to use as it does not require a complicated multi-stage setup or many new hyperparameters. Our first claim is that online distillation enables us to use extra parallelism to fit very large datasets about twice as fast. Crucially, we can still speed up training even after we have already reached the point at which additional parallelism provides no benefit for synchronous or asynchronous stochastic gradient descent. Two neural networks trained on disjoint subsets of the data can share knowledge by encouraging each model to agree with the predictions the other model would have made. These predictions can come from a stale version of the other model so they can be safely computed using weights that only rarely get transmitted. Our second claim is that online distillation is a cost-effective way to make the exact predictions of a model dramatically more reproducible. We support our claims using experiments on the Criteo Display Ad Challenge dataset, ImageNet, and the largest to-date dataset used for neural language modeling, containing $6\\times 10^{11}$ tokens and based on the Common Crawl repository of web data.",

    "abstract": "Learning to learn is a powerful paradigm for enabling models to learn from data more effectively and efficiently. A popular approach to meta-learning is to train a recurrent model to read in a training dataset as input and output the parameters of a learned model, or output predictions for new test inputs. Alternatively, a more recent approach to meta-learning aims to acquire deep representations that can be effectively fine-tuned, via standard gradient descent, to new tasks. In this paper, we consider the meta-learning problem from the perspective of universality, formalizing the notion of learning algorithm approximation and comparing the expressive power of the aforementioned recurrent models to the more recent approaches that embed gradient descent into the meta-learner. In particular, we seek to answer the following question: does deep representation combined with standard gradient descent have sufficient capacity to approximate any learning algorithm? We find that this is indeed true, and further find, in our experiments, that gradient-based meta-learning consistently leads to learning strategies that generalize more widely compared to those represented by recurrent models.",

    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that one can train a neural network with binary weights and activations at train time by augmenting the weights with a high-precision continuous latent variable that accumulates small changes from stochastic gradient descent. However, there is a dearth of work to explain why one can effectively capture the features in data with binary weights and activations. Our main result is that the neural networks with binary weights and activations trained using the method of Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016) work because of the high-dimensional geometry of binary vectors. In particular, the ideal continuous vectors that extract out features in the intermediate representations of these BNNs are well-approximated by binary vectors in the sense that dot products are approximately preserved. Compared to previous research that demonstrated good classification performance with BNNs, our work explains why these BNNs work in terms of HD geometry.  Furthermore, the results and analysis used on BNNs are shown to generalize to neural networks with ternary weights and activations. Our theory serves as a foundation for understanding not only BNNs but a variety of methods that seek to compress traditional neural networks. Furthermore, a better understanding of multilayer binary neural networks serves as a starting point for generalizing BNNs to other neural network architectures such as recurrent neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Neural network-based classifiers parallel or exceed human-level accuracy on many common tasks and are used in practical systems. Yet, neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, carefully perturbed inputs that cause networks to misbehave in arbitrarily chosen ways. When generated with standard methods, these examples do not consistently fool a classifier in the physical world due to a combination of viewpoint shifts, camera noise, and other natural transformations. Adversarial examples generated using standard techniques require complete control over direct input to the classifier, which is impossible in many real-world systems.\n\nWe introduce the first method for constructing real-world 3D objects that consistently fool a neural network across a wide distribution of angles and viewpoints. We present a general-purpose algorithm for generating adversarial examples that are robust across any chosen distribution of transformations. We demonstrate its application in two dimensions, producing adversarial images that are robust to noise, distortion, and affine transformation. Finally, we apply the algorithm to produce arbitrary physical 3D-printed adversarial objects, demonstrating that our approach works end-to-end in the real world. Our results show that adversarial examples are a practical concern for real-world systems.\n",

We present a novel framework that utilizes black-box function evaluations, in conjunction with symbolic expressions that integrate relationships between the given functions. We employ tree LSTMs to incorporate the structure of the symbolic expression trees.

We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) \ndecouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam, and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter).\nWe also demonstrate that longer optimization runs require smaller weight decay values for optimal results and introduce a normalized variant of weight decay to reduce this dependence.

The MLMDP can perform never-before-seen tasks by representing them as a linear combination of a previously learned basis set of tasks. In this setting, the subtask discovery problem can naturally be posed as finding an optimal low-rank approximation of the set of tasks the agent will face in a domain. We use non-negative matrix factorization to discover this minimal basis set of tasks, and show that the technique learns intuitive decompositions in a variety of domains. Our method has several qualitatively desirable features: it is not limited to learning subtasks with single goal states, instead learning distributed patterns of preferred states; it learns qualitatively different hierarchical decompositions in the same domain depending on the ensemble of tasks the agent will face; and it may be straightforwardly iterated to obtain deeper hierarchical decompositions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread interest in generative adversarial networks (GANs), few works have studied the metrics that quantitatively evaluate GANs' performance. In this paper, we revisit several representative sample-based evaluation metrics for GANs, and address the important problem of \\emph{how to evaluate the evaluation metrics}. We start with a few necessary conditions for metrics to produce meaningful scores, such as distinguishing real from generated samples, identifying mode dropping and mode collapsing, and detecting overfitting. Then with a series of carefully designed experiments,  we are able to comprehensively investigate existing sample-based metrics and identify their strengths and limitations in practical settings. Based on these results, we observe that kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the 1-Nearest-Neighbour (1-NN) two-sample test seem to satisfy most of the desirable properties, provided that the distances between samples are computed in a suitable feature space. Our experiments also unveil interesting properties about the behavior of several popular GAN models, such as whether they are memorizing training samples, and how far these state-of-the-art GANs are from perfect.",

    "abstract": "The key attribute that drives the unprecedented success of modern Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) on learning tasks which involve sequential data, is their ever-improving ability to model intricate long-term temporal dependencies. However, a well established measure of RNNs' long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus formal understanding of their ability to correlate data throughout time is limited. Though depth efficiency in convolutional networks is well established by now, it does not suffice in order to account for the success of deep RNNs on inputs of varying lengths, and the need to address their 'time-series expressive power' arises. In this paper, we analyze the effect of depth on the ability of recurrent networks to express correlations ranging over long time-scales. To meet the above need, we introduce a measure of the information flow across time that can be supported by the network, referred to as the Start-End separation rank. Essentially, this measure reflects the distance of the function realized by the recurrent network from a function that models no interaction whatsoever between the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep recurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are exponentially higher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Moreover, we show that the ability of deep recurrent networks to correlate different parts of the input sequence increases exponentially as the input sequence extends, while that of vanilla shallow recurrent networks does not adapt to the sequence length at all. Thus, we establish that depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent networks to model long-term dependencies, and provide an exemplar of quantifying this key attribute which may be readily extended to other RNN architectures of interest, e.g. variants of LSTM networks. We obtain our results by considering a class of recurrent networks referred to as Recurrent Arithmetic Circuits (RACs), which merge the hidden state with the input via the Multiplicative Integration operation.",

Even though it has recently been shown that GAN training converges, GAN models often end up in local Nash equilibria that are associated with mode collapse or otherwise fail to model the target distribution. We introduce Coulomb GANs, which pose the GAN learning problem as a potential field, where generated samples are attracted to training set samples but repel each other. The discriminator learns a potential field while the generator decreases the energy by moving its samples along the vector (force) field determined by the gradient of the potential field. Through decreasing the energy, the GAN model learns to generate samples according to the whole target distribution and does not only cover some of its modes. We prove that Coulomb GANs possess only one Nash equilibrium which is optimal in the sense that the model distribution equals the target distribution. We show the efficacy of Coulomb GANs on LSUN bedrooms, CelebA faces, CIFAR-10 and the Google Billion Word text generation.",

We introduce a method for training GANs with discrete data that uses the estimated difference measure from the discriminator to compute importance weights for generated samples, thus providing a policy gradient for training the generator. The importance weights have a strong connection to the decision boundary of the discriminator, and we call our method boundary-seeking GANs (BGANs).

    "abstract": "This paper presents a storage-efficient learning model titled Recursive Binary Neural Networks for embedded and mobile devices having a limited amount of on-chip data storage such as hundreds of kilo-Bytes. The main idea of the proposed model is to recursively recycle data storage of weights (parameters) during training. This enables a device with a given storage constraint to train and instantiate a neural network classifier with a larger number of weights on a chip, achieving better classification accuracy. Such efficient use of on-chip storage reduces off-chip storage accesses, improving energy-efficiency and speed of training. We verified the proposed training model with deep and convolutional neural network classifiers on the MNIST and voice activity detection benchmarks. For the deep neural network, our model achieves data storage requirement of as low as 2 bits/weight, whereas the conventional binary neural network learning models require data storage of 8 to 32 bits/weight. With the same amount of data storage, our model can train a bigger network having more weights, achieving 1% less test error than the conventional binary neural network learning model. To achieve the similar classification error, the conventional binary neural network model requires 4\u00d7 more data storage for weights than our proposed model. For the convolution neural network classifier, the proposed model achieves 2.4% less test error for the same on-chip storage or 6\u00d7 storage savings to achieve the similar accuracy.\n",

    "abstract": "A major drawback of backpropagation through time (BPTT) is the difficulty of learning long-term dependencies, coming from having to propagate credit information backwards through every single step of the forward computation. This makes BPTT both computationally impractical and biologically implausible. For this reason, full backpropagation through time is rarely used on long sequences, and truncated backpropagation through time is used as a heuristic.  However, this usually leads to biased estimates of the gradient in which longer term dependencies are ignored.  Addressing this issue, we propose an alternative algorithm, Sparse Attentive Backtracking, which might also be related to principles used by brains to learn long-term dependencies. Sparse Attentive Backtracking learns an attention mechanism over the hidden states of the past and selectively backpropagates through paths with high attention weights.  This allows the model to learn long term dependencies while only backtracking for a small number of time steps, not just from the recent past but also from attended relevant past states.   ",

It is essential towards the development of intelligent machines that can adapt to their surroundings. In this work we focus on a lifelong learning approach to generative modeling where we continuously incorporate newly observed streaming distributions into our learnt model. We do so through a student-teacher architecture which allows us to learn and preserve all the distributions seen so far without the need to retain the past data nor the past models. Through the introduction of a novel cross-model regularizer, the student model leverages the information learnt by the teacher, which acts as a summary of everything seen till now. The regularizer has the additional benefit of reducing the effect of catastrophic interference that appears when we learn over streaming data. We demonstrate its efficacy on streaming distributions as well as its ability to learn a common latent representation across a complex transfer learning scenario.\n",

In this work, we completely remove the need of parallel data and propose a novel method to train an NMT system in a completely unsupervised manner, relying on nothing but monolingual corpora. Our model builds upon the recent work on unsupervised embedding mappings, and consists of a slightly modified attentional encoder-decoder model that can be trained on monolingual corpora alone using a combination of denoising and backtranslation. Despite the simplicity of the approach, our system obtains 15.56 and 10.21 BLEU points in WMT 2014 French-to-English and German-to-English translation.

    "abstract": "We propose in this paper a new approach to train the Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) with a mixture of generators to overcome the mode collapsing problem. The main intuition is to employ multiple generators, instead of using a single one as in the original GAN. The idea is simple, yet proven to be extremely effective at covering diverse data modes, easily overcoming the mode collapsing problem and delivering state-of-the-art results. A minimax formulation was able to establish among a classifier, a discriminator, and a set of generators in a similar spirit with GAN. Generators create samples that are intended to come from the same distribution as the training data, whilst the discriminator determines whether samples are true data or generated by generators, and the classifier specifies which generator a sample comes from. The distinguishing feature is that internal samples are created from multiple generators, and then one of them will be randomly selected as final output similar to the mechanism of a probabilistic mixture model. We term our method Mixture Generative Adversarial Nets (MGAN). We develop theoretical analysis to prove that, at the equilibrium, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the mixture of generators\u2019 distributions and the empirical data distribution is minimal, whilst the JSD among generators\u2019 distributions is maximal, hence effectively avoiding the mode collapsing problem. By utilizing parameter sharing, our proposed model adds minimal computational cost to the standard GAN, and thus can also efficiently scale to large-scale datasets. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic 2D data and natural image databases (CIFAR-10, STL-10 and ImageNet) to demonstrate the superior performance of our MGAN in achieving state-of-the-art Inception scores over latest baselines, generating diverse and appealing recognizable objects at different resolutions, and specializing in capturing different types of objects by the generators.",

    "abstract": "Program synthesis is the task of automatically generating a program consistent with\na specification. Recent years have seen proposal of a number of neural approaches\nfor program synthesis, many of which adopt a sequence generation paradigm similar\nto neural machine translation, in which sequence-to-sequence models are trained to\nmaximize the likelihood of known reference programs. While achieving impressive\nresults, this strategy has two key limitations. First, it ignores Program Aliasing: the\nfact that many different programs may satisfy a given specification (especially with\nincomplete specifications such as a few input-output examples). By maximizing\nthe likelihood of only a single reference program, it penalizes many semantically\ncorrect programs, which can adversely affect the synthesizer performance. Second,\nthis strategy overlooks the fact that programs have a strict syntax that can be\nefficiently checked. To address the first limitation, we perform reinforcement\nlearning on top of a supervised model with an objective that explicitly maximizes\nthe likelihood of generating semantically correct programs. For addressing the\nsecond limitation, we introduce a training procedure that directly maximizes the\nprobability of generating syntactically correct programs that fulfill the specification.\nWe show that our contributions lead to improved accuracy of the models, especially\nin cases where the training data is limited.",

    "abstract": "Neural programs are highly accurate and structured policies that perform algorithmic tasks by controlling the behavior of a computation mechanism. Despite the potential to increase the interpretability and the compositionality of the behavior of artificial agents, it remains difficult to learn from demonstrations neural networks that represent computer programs. The main challenges that set algorithmic domains apart from other imitation learning domains are the need for high accuracy, the involvement of specific structures of data, and the extremely limited observability. To address these challenges, we propose to model programs as Parametrized Hierarchical Procedures (PHPs). A PHP is a sequence of conditional operations, that uses a program counter, along with the observation, to select between taking an elementary action, invoking another PHP as a sub-procedure, and returning to the caller. We develop an algorithm for training PHPs from a mixture of annotated and unannotated demonstrations, and apply it to efficient level-wise training of multi-level PHPs. We show in two benchmarks, NanoCraft and long-hand addition, that PHPs can learn neural programs more accurately from smaller amounts of strong and weak supervision.",

    "abstract": "We investigate in this paper the architecture of deep convolutional networks. Building on existing state of the art models, we propose a reconfiguration of the model parameters into several parallel branches at the global network level, with each branch being a standalone CNN. We show that this arrangement is an efficient way to significantly reduce the number of parameters while at the same time improving the performance. The use of branches brings an additional form of regularization. In addition to splitting the parameters into parallel branches, we propose a tighter coupling of these branches by averaging their log-probabilities. The tighter coupling favours the learning of better representations, even at the level of the individual branches, as compared to when each branch is trained independently. We refer to this branched architecture as \"coupled ensembles\". The approach is very generic and can be applied with almost any neural network architecture. With coupled ensembles of DenseNet-BC and parameter budget of 25M, we obtain error rates of 2.92%, 15.68% and 1.50% respectively on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN tasks. For the same parameter budget, DenseNet-BC has an error rate of 3.46%, 17.18%, and 1.8% respectively.  With ensembles of coupled ensembles, of DenseNet-BC networks, with 50M total parameters, we obtain error rates of 2.72%, 15.13% and 1.42% respectively on these tasks.",

In this work, we argue that this property might help explain the infamous mode collapse phenomenon in adversarially-trained generative models. Inspired by discrepancy measures and two-sample tests between probability distributions, we propose distributional adversaries that operate on samples, i.e., on sets of multiple points drawn from a distribution, rather than on single observations. We show how they can be easily implemented on top of existing models. Various experimental results show that generators trained in combination with our distributional adversaries are much more stable and are remarkably less prone to mode collapse than traditional models trained with observation-wise prediction discriminators. In addition, the application of our framework to domain adaptation results in strong improvement over recent state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "The seemingly infinite diversity of the natural world arises from a relatively small set of coherent rules, such as the laws of physics or chemistry. We conjecture that these rules give rise to regularities that can be discovered through primarily unsupervised experiences and represented as abstract concepts. If such representations are compositional and hierarchical, they can be recombined into an exponentially large set of new concepts. This paper describes SCAN (Symbol-Concept Association Network), a new framework for learning such abstractions in the visual domain. SCAN learns concepts through fast symbol association, grounding them in disentangled visual primitives that are discovered in an unsupervised manner. Unlike state of the art multimodal generative model baselines, our approach requires very few pairings between symbols and images and makes no assumptions about the form of symbol representations. Once trained, SCAN is capable of multimodal bi-directional inference, generating a diverse set of image samples from symbolic descriptions and vice versa. It also allows for traversal and manipulation of the implicit hierarchy of visual concepts through symbolic instructions and learnt logical recombination operations. Such manipulations enable SCAN to break away from its training data distribution and imagine novel visual concepts through symbolically instructed recombination of previously learnt concepts.",

    "abstract": "Despite the state-of-the-art accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in various classification problems, their deployment onto resource constrained edge computing devices remains challenging, due to their large size and complexity. Several recent studies have reported remarkable results in reducing this complexity through quantization of DNN models. However, these studies usually do not consider the change in loss when performing quantization, nor do they take the disparate importance of DNN connections to the accuracy into account. We address these issues in this paper by proposing a new method, called adaptive quantization, which simplifies a trained DNN model by finding a unique, optimal precision for each connection weight such that the increase in loss is minimized. The optimization problem at the core of this method iteratively uses the loss function gradient to determine an error margin for each weight and assign it a precision accordingly. Since this problem uses linear functions, it is computationally cheap and, as we will show, has a closed-form approximate solution. Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR, and SVHN datasets showed that the proposed method can achieve near or better than state-of-the-art reduction in model size with similar error rate. Furthermore, it can achieve compressions close to floating-point model compression methods without loss of accuracy.\n",

Here, we argue that, despite recent progress in visual recognition, modern machine vision algorithms are severely limited in their ability to learn visual relations. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that visual-relation problems strain convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The networks eventually break altogether when rote memorization becomes impossible such as when the intra-class variability exceeds their capacity. We further show that another type of feedforward network, called a relational network (RN), which was shown to successfully solve seemingly difficult visual question answering (VQA) problems on the CLEVR datasets, suffers similar limitations. Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, we argue that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have become the state-of-the-art models in numerous machine learning tasks. However, general guidance to network architecture design is still missing. In our work, we bridge deep neural network design with numerical differential equations. We show that many effective networks, such as ResNet, PolyNet, FractalNet and RevNet, can be interpreted as different numerical discretizations of differential equations. This finding brings us a brand new perspective on the design of effective deep architectures. We can take advantage of the rich knowledge in numerical analysis to guide us in designing new and potentially more effective deep networks. As an example, we propose a linear multi-step architecture (LM-architecture) which is inspired by the linear multi-step method solving ordinary differential equations. The LM-architecture is an effective structure that can be used on any ResNet-like networks. In particular, we demonstrate that LM-ResNet and LM-ResNeXt (i.e. the networks obtained by applying the LM-architecture on ResNet and ResNeXt respectively) can achieve noticeably higher accuracy than ResNet and ResNeXt on both CIFAR and ImageNet with comparable numbers of trainable parameters. In particular, on both CIFAR and ImageNet, LM-ResNet/LM-ResNeXt can significantly compress (&gt;50%) the original networks while maintaining a similar performance. This can be explained mathematically using the concept of modified equation from numerical analysis. Last but not least, we also establish a connection between stochastic control and noise injection in the training process which helps to improve generalization of the networks. Furthermore, by relating stochastic training strategy with stochastic dynamic system, we can easily apply stochastic training to the networks with the LM-architecture. As an example, we introduced stochastic depth to LM-ResNet and achieve significant improvement over the original LM-ResNet on CIFAR10.",

    "abstract": " For fast and energy-efficient deployment of trained deep neural networks on resource-constrained embedded hardware, each learned weight parameter should ideally be represented and stored using a single bit. Error-rates usually increase when this requirement is imposed. Here, we report large improvements in error rates on multiple datasets, for deep convolutional neural networks deployed with 1-bit-per-weight. Using wide residual networks as our main baseline, our approach simplifies existing methods that binarize weights by applying the sign function in training; we apply scaling factors for each layer with constant unlearned values equal to the layer-specific standard deviations used for initialization. For CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet, and models with 1-bit-per-weight requiring less than 10 MB of parameter memory, we achieve error rates of 3.9%, 18.5% and 26.0% / 8.5% (Top-1 / Top-5) respectively. We also considered MNIST, SVHN and ImageNet32, achieving 1-bit-per-weight test results of 0.27%, 1.9%, and 41.3% / 19.1% respectively. For CIFAR, our error rates halve previously reported values, and are within about 1% of our error-rates for the same network with full-precision weights. For networks that overfit, we also show significant improvements in error rate by not learning batch normalization scale and offset parameters. This applies to both full precision and 1-bit-per-weight networks. Using a warm-restart learning-rate schedule, we found that training for 1-bit-perweight is just as fast as full-precision networks, with better accuracy than standard schedules, and achieved about 98%-99% of peak performance in just 62 training epochs for CIFAR 10/100.",

However, an agent that is trained using RL is only capable of achieving the single task that is specified via its reward function.   Such an approach does not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to perform a diverse set of tasks, such as navigating to varying positions in a room or moving objects to varying locations.  Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable of performing in its environment.  We use a generator network to propose tasks for the agent to try to achieve, each task being specified as reaching a certain parametrized subset of the state-space.  The generator network is optimized using adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level of difficulty for the agent.  Our method thus automatically produces a curriculum of tasks for the agent to learn.  We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically learn to perform a wide set of tasks without requiring any prior knowledge of its environment (Videos and code available at: <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/goalgeneration4rl\">https://sites.google.com/view/goalgeneration4rl</a>).

Our method, termed Generative Adversarial Nets for inference of Individualized Treatment Effects (GANITE), is motivated by the possibility that we can capture the uncertainty in the counterfactual distributions by attempting to learn them using a GAN. We generate proxies of the counterfactual outcomes using a counterfactual generator, G, and then pass these proxies to an ITE generator, I, in order to train it. By modeling both of these using the GAN framework, we are able to infer based on the factual data, while still accounting for the unseen counterfactuals. We test our method on three real-world datasets (with both binary and multiple treatments) and show that GANITE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Conventional model compression methods attempt to address this problem by modifying the architecture manually or using pre-defined heuristics. Since the space of all reduced architectures is very large, modifying the architecture of a deep neural network in this way is a difficult task. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing a principled method for learning reduced network architectures in a data-driven way using reinforcement learning. Our approach takes a larger 'teacher' network as input and outputs a compressed 'student' network derived from the 'teacher' network. In the first stage of our method, a recurrent policy network aggressively removes layers from the large 'teacher' model. In the second stage, another  recurrent policy network carefully reduces the size of each remaining layer. The resulting network is then evaluated to obtain a reward -- a score based on the accuracy and compression of the network. Our approach uses this reward signal with policy gradients to train the policies to find a locally optimal student network. Our experiments show that we can achieve compression rates of more than 10x for models such as ResNet-34 while maintaining similar performance to the input 'teacher' network. We also present a valuable transfer learning result which shows that policies which are pre-trained on smaller 'teacher' networks can be used to rapidly speed up training on larger 'teacher' networks.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are carefully crafted instances aiming to cause prediction errors for DNNs. Recent research on adversarial examples has examined local neighborhoods in the input space of DNN models. However, previous work has limited what regions to consider, focusing either on low-dimensional subspaces or small balls. In this paper, we argue that information from larger neighborhoods, such as from more directions and from greater distances, will better characterize the relationship between adversarial examples and the DNN models. First, we introduce an attack, OPTMARGIN, that generates adversarial examples robust to small perturbations. These examples successfully evade a defense that only considers a small ball around an input instance. Second, we analyze a larger neighborhood around input instances by looking at properties of surrounding decision boundaries, namely the distances to the boundaries and the adjacent classes. We find that the boundaries around these adversarial examples do not resemble the boundaries around benign examples. Finally, we show that, under scrutiny of the surrounding decision boundaries, our OPTMARGIN examples do not convincingly mimic benign examples. Although our experiments are limited to a few specific attacks, we hope these findings will motivate new, more evasive attacks and ultimately, effective defenses. \n",

    "abstract": "In representational lifelong learning an agent aims to continually learn to solve novel tasks while updating its representation in light of previous tasks. Under the assumption that future tasks are related to previous tasks, representations should be learned in such a way that they capture the common structure across learned tasks, while allowing the learner sufficient flexibility to adapt to novel aspects of a new task. We develop a framework for lifelong learning in deep neural networks that is based on generalization bounds, developed within the PAC-Bayes framework. Learning takes place through the construction of a distribution over networks based on the tasks seen so far, and its utilization for learning a new task. Thus, prior knowledge is incorporated through setting a history-dependent prior for novel tasks. We develop a gradient-based algorithm implementing these ideas, based on minimizing an objective function motivated by generalization bounds, and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical examples.

    "abstract": "Amortized inference has led to efficient approximate inference for large datasets. The quality of posterior inference is largely determined by two factors: a) the ability of the variational distribution to model the true posterior and b) the capacity of the recognition network to generalize inference over all datapoints. We analyze approximate inference in variational autoencoders in terms of these factors. We find that suboptimal inference is often due to amortizing inference rather than the limited complexity of the approximating distribution. We show that this is due partly to the generator learning to accommodate the choice of approximation. Furthermore, we show that the parameters used to increase the expressiveness of the approximation play a role in generalizing inference rather than simply improving the complexity of the approximation.",

Previously, it has been shown that neural network agents can learn to communicate in compositional language based on disentangled input (e.g. hand-engineered features). Humans, however, do not learn to communicate based on well-summarized features. In this work, we train neural network agents to simultaneously develop visual perception from raw pixels, and learn to communicate in compositional language. The agents play an image description game where the image contains compositional factors such as colors and shapes. We train the agents using the obverter technique where an agent introspects to generate a message that best makes sense to itself. During the zero-shot test, agents could communicate with accuracy as high as 97% even for objects not seen during the training, providing evidence that neural network agents are capable of learning compositional language even from raw image pixels.",

In our models, the representation of a word has two parts, the embedding of the word itself, and a weighting matrix to interact with the local context, referred to as local context unit. The region embeddings are learned and used in the classification task, as parameters of the neural network classifier. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods in text classification on several benchmark datasets.

However, most existing methods are post-processing approaches in that they take a learned neural network as input and output a compressed network by either forcing several parameters to take the same value (parameter tying via quantization) or pruning irrelevant edges (pruning) or both. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that jointly learns and compresses a neural network. The key idea in our approach is to change the optimization criteria by adding $k$ independent Gaussian priors over the parameters and a sparsity penalty. We show that our approach is easy to implement using existing neural network libraries, generalizes L1 and L2 regularization and elegantly enforces parameter tying as well as pruning constraints. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our new algorithm yields state-of-the-art compression on several standard benchmarks with minimal loss in accuracy while requiring little to no hyperparameter tuning as compared with related, competing approaches.

    "abstract": "To construct representations for natural language sequences, information from two main sources needs to be captured: (i) semantic meaning of individual words, and (ii) their compositionality. These two types of information are usually represented in the form of word embeddings and compositional functions, respectively. For the latter, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been considered. There has not been a rigorous evaluation regarding the relative importance of each component to different text-representation-based tasks; i.e., how important is the modeling capacity of word embeddings alone, relative to the added value of a compositional function? In this paper, we conduct an extensive comparative study between Simple Word Embeddings-based Models (SWEMs), with no compositional parameters, relative to employing word embeddings within RNN/CNN-based models. Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered. Moreover, in a new SWEM setup, we propose to employ a max-pooling operation over the learned word-embedding matrix of a given sentence. This approach is demonstrated to extract complementary features relative to the averaging operation standard to SWEMs, while endowing our model with better interpretability. To further validate our observations, we examine the information utilized by different models to make predictions, revealing interesting properties of word embeddings.\n",

To scale this technique to large datasets, perturbations are crafted using fast single-step methods that maximize a linear approximation of the model's loss.\nWe show that this form of adversarial training converges to a degenerate global minimum, wherein small curvature artifacts near the data points obfuscate a linear approximation of the loss. The model thus learns to generate weak perturbations, rather than defend against strong ones. As a result, we find that adversarial training remains vulnerable to black-box attacks, where we transfer perturbations computed on undefended models, as well as to a powerful novel single-step attack that escapes the non-smooth vicinity of the input data via a small random step.\nWe further introduce Ensemble Adversarial Training, a technique that augments training data with perturbations transferred from other models. On ImageNet, Ensemble Adversarial Training yields models with strong robustness to black-box attacks.

Based on our analysis we propose to modify the prior code distribution to put significantly more probability mass closer to the origin. As a result, linear interpolation paths are not only shortest paths, but they are also guaranteed to pass through high-density regions, irrespective of the dimensionality of the latent space. Experiments on standard benchmark image datasets demonstrate clear visual improvements in the quality of the generated samples and exhibit more meaningful interpolation paths.",

Following recent work in simplifying these networks with model pruning\nand a novel mapping of work onto GPUs, we design an efficient implementation for sparse RNNs. We investigate several optimizations and tradeoffs: Lamport timestamps, wide memory loads, and a bank-aware weight layout. With these optimizations, we achieve speedups of over 6x over the next best algorithm for a hidden layer of size 2304, batch size of 4, and a\ndensity of 30%. Further, our technique allows for models of over 5x the size to fit on a GPU for a speedup of 2x , enabling larger networks to help advance the state-of-the-art. We perform case studies on NMT and speech recognition tasks in the appendix, accelerating their recurrent layers by up to 3x.",

    "abstract": "Retinal prostheses for treating incurable blindness are designed to electrically stimulate surviving retinal neurons,  causing them to send artificial visual signals to the brain. However, electrical stimulation generally cannot precisely reproduce  normal patterns of neural activity in the retina. Therefore, an electrical stimulus must be selected that produces a neural response as close as possible to the desired response. This requires a technique for computing a distance between the desired response and the achievable response that is meaningful in terms of the visual signal being conveyed. Here we propose a method to learn such a metric on neural responses, directly from recorded light responses of a population of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the primate retina. The learned metric produces a measure of similarity of RGC population responses that accurately reflects the similarity of the visual input. Using data from electrical stimulation experiments, we demonstrate that this metric may improve the performance of a prosthesis.",

    "abstract": "Reading comprehension is a challenging task, especially when executed across longer or across multiple evidence documents, where the answer is likely to reoccur. Existing neural architectures typically do not scale to the entire evidence, and hence, resort to selecting a single passage in the document (either via truncation or other means), and carefully searching for the answer within that passage. However, in some cases, this strategy can be suboptimal,  since by focusing on a specific passage, it becomes difficult to leverage multiple mentions of the same answer throughout the document. In this work, we take a different approach by constructing lightweight models that are combined in a cascade to find the answer. Each submodel consists only of feed-forward networks equipped with an attention mechanism, making it trivially parallelizable. We show that our approach can scale to approximately an order of magnitude larger evidence documents and can aggregate information from multiple mentions of each answer candidate across the document. Empirically, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the Wikipedia and web domains of the TriviaQA dataset, outperforming more complex, recurrent architectures.",

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks requires many training samples, but in practice training labels are expensive to obtain and may be of varying quality, as some may be from trusted expert labelers while others might be from heuristics or other sources of weak supervision such as crowd-sourcing. This creates a fundamental quality- versus-quantity trade-off in the learning process. Do we learn from the small amount of high-quality data or the potentially large amount of weakly-labeled data? We argue that if the learner could somehow know and take the label-quality into account when learning the data representation, we could get the best of both worlds. To this end, we propose \u201cfidelity-weighted learning\u201d (FWL), a semi-supervised student- teacher approach for training deep neural networks using weakly-labeled data. FWL modulates the parameter updates to a student network (trained on the task we care about) on a per-sample basis according to the posterior confidence of its label-quality estimated by a teacher (who has access to the high-quality labels). Both student and teacher are learned from the data. We evaluate FWL on two tasks in information retrieval and natural language processing where we outperform state-of-the-art alternative semi-supervised methods, indicating that our approach makes better use of strong and weak labels, and leads to better task-dependent data representations.",

Entropy-SGD works by optimizing the bound\u2019s prior, violating the hypothesis of the PAC-Bayes theorem that the prior is chosen independently of the data. Indeed, available implementations of Entropy-SGD rapidly obtain zero training error on random labels and the same holds of the Gibbs posterior. In order to obtain a valid generalization bound, we show that an \u03b5-differentially private prior yields a valid PAC-Bayes bound, a straightforward consequence of results connecting generalization with differential privacy. Using stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to approximate the well-known exponential release mechanism, we observe that generalization error on MNIST (measured on held out data) falls within the (empirically nonvacuous) bounds computed under the assumption that SGLD produces perfect samples. In particular, Entropy-SGLD can be configured to yield relatively tight generalization bounds and still fit real labels, although these same settings do not obtain state-of-the-art performance.",

The images are synthetic, scientific-style figures from five classes: line plots, dot-line plots, vertical and horizontal bar graphs, and pie charts. We formulate our reasoning task by generating questions from 15 templates; questions concern various relationships between plot elements and examine characteristics like the maximum, the minimum, area-under-the-curve, smoothness, and intersection. To resolve, such questions often require reference to multiple plot elements and synthesis of information distributed spatially throughout a figure. To facilitate the training of machine learning systems, the corpus also includes side data that can be used to formulate auxiliary objectives. In particular, we provide the numerical data used to generate each figure as well as bounding-box annotations for all plot elements. We study the proposed visual reasoning task by training several models, including the recently proposed Relation Network as strong baseline. Preliminary results indicate that the task poses a significant machine learning challenge. We envision FigureQA as a first step towards developing models that can intuitively recognize patterns from visual representations of data.",

The DSN is achieved by cascading  wavelet transform convolutions with a complex modulus and a time-invariant operator. We extend this work by first,\ncrossing multiple wavelet family transforms to increase the feature diversity while avoiding any learning. Thus providing a more informative latent representation and benefit from the development of highly specialized wavelet filters over the last decades. Beside, by combining all the different wavelet representations, we reduce the amount of prior information needed regarding the signals at hand.\nSecondly, we develop an optimal thresholding strategy for over-complete filter banks that regularizes the network and controls instabilities such as inherent non-stationary noise in the signal. Our systematic and principled solution sparsifies the latent representation of the network by acting as a local mask distinguishing between activity and noise. Thus, we propose to enhance the DSN by increasing the variance of the scattering coefficients representation as well as improve its robustness with respect to non-stationary noise.\nWe show that our new approach is more robust and outperforms the DSN on a bird detection task.",

Recent progress in few-shot\nclassification has featured meta-learning, in which a parameterized model for a\nlearning algorithm is defined and trained on episodes representing different clas-\nsification problems, each with a small labeled training set and its corresponding\ntest set. In this work, we advance this few-shot classification paradigm towards\na scenario where unlabeled examples are also available within each episode. We\nconsider two situations: one where all unlabeled examples are assumed to belong\nto the same set of classes as the labeled examples of the episode, as well as the\nmore challenging situation where examples from other distractor classes are also\nprovided. To address this paradigm, we propose novel extensions of Prototypical\nNetworks (Snell et al., 2017) that are augmented with the ability to use unlabeled\nexamples when producing prototypes. These models are trained in an end-to-end\nway on episodes, to learn to leverage the unlabeled examples successfully.

    "abstract": "Knowledge bases (KB), both automatically and manually constructed, are often incomplete --- many valid facts can be inferred from the KB by synthesizing existing information. A popular approach to KB completion is to infer new relations by combinatory reasoning over the information found along other paths connecting a pair of entities. Given the enormous size of KBs and the exponential number of paths, previous path-based models have considered only the problem of predicting a missing relation given two entities, or evaluating the truth of a proposed triple. Additionally, these methods have traditionally used random paths between fixed entity pairs or more recently learned to pick paths between them. We propose a new algorithm, MINERVA, which addresses the much more difficult and practical task of answering questions where the relation is known, but only one entity. Since random walks are impractical in a setting with combinatorially many destinations from a start node, we present a neural reinforcement learning approach which learns how to navigate the graph conditioned on the input query to find predictive paths. Empirically, this approach obtains state-of-the-art results on several datasets, significantly outperforming prior methods. ",

    "abstract": "Learning to predict complex time-series data is a fundamental challenge in a range of disciplines including Machine Learning, Robotics, and Natural Language Processing. Predictive State Recurrent Neural Networks (PSRNNs) (Downey et al.) are a state-of-the-art approach for modeling time-series data which combine the benefits of probabilistic filters and Recurrent Neural Networks into a single model. PSRNNs leverage the concept of Hilbert Space Embeddings of distributions (Smola et al.) to embed predictive states into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, then estimate, predict, and update these embedded states using Kernel Bayes Rule. Practical implementations of PSRNNs are made possible by the machinery of Random Features, where input features are mapped into a new space where dot products approximate the kernel well. Unfortunately PSRNNs often require a large number of RFs to obtain good results, resulting in large models which are slow to execute and slow to train. Orthogonal Random Features (ORFs) (Choromanski et al.) is an improvement on RFs which has been shown to decrease the number of RFs required for pointwise kernel approximation. Unfortunately, it is not clear that ORFs can be applied to PSRNNs, as PSRNNs rely on Kernel Ridge Regression as a core component of their learning algorithm, and the theoretical guarantees of ORF do not apply in this setting. In this paper, we extend the theory of ORFs to Kernel Ridge Regression and show that ORFs can be used to obtain Orthogonal PSRNNs (OPSRNNs), which are smaller and faster than PSRNNs. In particular, we show that OPSRNN models clearly outperform LSTMs and furthermore, can achieve accuracy similar to PSRNNs with an order of magnitude smaller number of features needed.",

CENs are deep networks that generate parameters for context-specific probabilistic graphical models which are further used for prediction and play the role of explanations. Contrary to the existing post-hoc model-explanation tools, CENs learn to predict and to explain jointly. Our approach offers two major advantages: (i) for each prediction, valid instance-specific explanations are generated with no computational overhead and (ii) prediction via explanation acts as a regularization and boosts performance in low-resource settings. We prove that local approximations to the decision boundary of our networks are consistent with the generated explanations. Our results on image and text classification and survival analysis tasks demonstrate that CENs are competitive with the state-of-the-art while offering additional insights behind each prediction, valuable for decision support.",

The natural solution of using more hardware is limited by diminishing returns, and leads to inefficient use of additional resources. In this paper, we present a large batch, stochastic optimization algorithm that is both faster than widely used algorithms for fixed amounts of computation, and also scales up substantially better as more computational resources become available. Our algorithm implicitly computes the inverse Hessian of each mini-batch to produce descent directions; we do so without either an explicit approximation to the Hessian or Hessian-vector products. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by successfully training large ImageNet models (InceptionV3, ResnetV1-50, ResnetV1-101 and InceptionResnetV2) with mini-batch sizes of up to 32000 with no loss in validation error relative to current baselines, and no increase in the total number of steps. At smaller mini-batch sizes, our optimizer improves the validation error in these models by 0.8-0.9\\%. Alternatively, we can trade off this accuracy to reduce the number of training steps needed by roughly 10-30\\%. Our work is practical and easily usable by others -- only one hyperparameter (learning rate) needs tuning, and furthermore, the algorithm is as computationally cheap as the commonly used Adam optimizer.",

It is derived in a principled way from the Lagrangian dual form of the Bellman optimality equation, which can be viewed as a two-player game between the actor and a critic-like function, which is named as dual critic.  Compared to its actor-critic relatives, Dual-AC has the desired property that the actor and dual critic are updated cooperatively to optimize the same objective function, providing a more transparent way for learning the critic that is directly related to the objective function of the actor. We then provide a concrete algorithm that can effectively solve the minimax optimization problem, using techniques of multi-step bootstrapping, path regularization, and stochastic dual ascent algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performances across several benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Over the last years, deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have transformed the field of computer vision thanks to their  unparalleled capacity to learn high level semantic image features. However, in order to successfully learn those features, they usually require massive amounts of manually labeled data, which is both expensive and impractical to scale. Therefore, unsupervised semantic feature learning, i.e., learning without requiring manual annotation effort, is of crucial importance in order to successfully harvest the vast amount of visual data that are available today. In our work we propose to learn image features by training ConvNets to recognize the 2d rotation that is applied to the image that it gets as input. We demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively that this apparently simple task actually provides a very powerful supervisory signal for semantic feature learning. We exhaustively evaluate our method in various unsupervised feature learning benchmarks and we exhibit in all of them state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, our results on those benchmarks demonstrate dramatic improvements w.r.t. prior state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised representation learning and thus significantly close the gap with supervised feature learning. For instance, in PASCAL VOC 2007 detection task our unsupervised pre-trained AlexNet model achieves the state-of-the-art (among unsupervised methods) mAP of 54.4% that is only 2.4 points lower from the supervised case. We get similar striking results when we transfer our unsupervised learned features on various other tasks, such as ImageNet classification, PASCAL classification, PASCAL segmentation, and CIFAR-10 classification.",

    "abstract": "The field of medical diagnostics contains a wealth of challenges which closely resemble classical machine learning problems; practical constraints, however, complicate the translation of these endpoints naively into classical architectures. Many tasks in radiology, for example, are largely problems of multi-label classification wherein medical images are interpreted to indicate multiple present or suspected pathologies. Clinical settings drive the necessity for high accuracy simultaneously across a multitude of pathological outcomes and greatly limit the utility of tools which consider only a subset. This issue is exacerbated by a general scarcity of training data and maximizes the need to extract clinically relevant features from available samples -- ideally without the use of pre-trained models which may carry forward undesirable biases from tangentially related tasks. We present and evaluate a partial solution to these constraints in using LSTMs to leverage interdependencies among target labels in predicting 14 pathologic patterns from chest x-rays and establish state of the art results on the largest publicly available chest x-ray dataset from the NIH without pre-training. Furthermore, we propose and discuss alternative evaluation metrics and their relevance in clinical practice.",

However, problems that exhibit considerable initial state variation typically produce high-variance gradient estimates for model-free RL, making direct policy or value function optimization challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm that instead optimizes an ensemble of policies, each on a different ``\"slice\" of the initial state space, and gradually unifies them into a single policy that can succeed on the whole state space. This approach, which we term divide-and-conquer RL, is able to solve complex tasks where conventional deep RL methods are ineffective. Our results show that divide-and-conquer RL greatly outperforms conventional policy gradient methods on challenging grasping, manipulation, and locomotion tasks, and exceeds the performance of a variety of prior methods.

In this paper, we study the emergence of communication in the negotiation environment, a semi-cooperative model of agent interaction. We introduce two communication protocols - one grounded in the semantics of the game, and one which is a priori ungrounded.  We show that self-interested agents can use the pre-grounded communication channel to negotiate fairly, but are unable to effectively use the ungrounded, cheap talk channel to do the same.  However, prosocial agents do learn to use cheap talk to find an optimal negotiating strategy, suggesting that cooperation is necessary for language to emerge. We also study communication behaviour in a setting where one agent interacts with agents in a community with different levels of prosociality and show how agent identifiability can aid negotiation.",

Our algorithm is motivated by the step size limitation of explicit gradient descent, which poses an impediment for optimization. ProxProp is developed from a general point of view on the backpropagation algorithm, currently the most common technique to train neural networks via stochastic gradient descent and variants thereof. Specifically, we show that backpropagation of a prediction error is equivalent to sequential gradient descent steps on a quadratic penalty energy, which comprises the network activations as variables of the optimization. We further analyze theoretical properties of ProxProp and in particular prove that the algorithm yields a descent direction in parameter space and can therefore be combined with a wide variety of convergent algorithms. Finally, we devise an efficient numerical implementation that integrates well with popular deep learning frameworks. We conclude by demonstrating promising numerical results and show that ProxProp can be effectively combined with common first order optimizers such as Adam.",

    "abstract": "Learning policies for complex tasks that require multiple different skills is a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). It is also a requirement for its deployment in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient multi-task reinforcement learning. Our framework trains agents to employ hierarchical policies that decide when to use a previously learned policy and when to learn a new skill. This enables agents to continually acquire new skills during different stages of training. Each learned task corresponds to a human language description. Because agents can only access previously learned skills through these descriptions, the agent can always provide a human-interpretable description of its choices. In order to help the agent learn the complex temporal dependencies necessary for the hierarchical policy, we provide it with a stochastic temporal grammar that modulates when to rely on previously learned skills and when to execute new skills. We validate our approach on Minecraft games designed to explicitly test the ability to reuse previously learned skills while simultaneously learning new skills.",

Compared to traditional one-vs-all classifiers that require $O(Kd)$ memory and inference cost, MACH only need $O(d\\log{K})$ memory while only requiring $O(K\\log{K} + d\\log{K})$ operation for inference. MACH is the first generic $K$-classification algorithm, with provably theoretical guarantees, which requires $O(\\log{K})$ memory without any assumption on the relationship between classes. MACH uses universal hashing to reduce classification with a large number of classes to few independent classification task with very small (constant) number of classes. We provide theoretical quantification of accuracy-memory tradeoff by showing the first connection between extreme classification and heavy hitters. With MACH we can train ODP dataset with 100,000 classes and 400,000 features on a single Titan X GPU (12GB), with the classification accuracy of 19.28\\%, which is the best-reported accuracy on this dataset. Before this work, the best performing baseline is a one-vs-all classifier that requires 40 billion parameters (320 GB model size) and achieves 9\\% accuracy.  In contrast, MACH can achieve 9\\% accuracy with 480x reduction in the model size (of mere 0.6GB).

Novel architectures such as ResNets and Highway networks have addressed this issue by introducing various flavors of skip-connections or gating mechanisms. However, the degradation problem persists in the context of plain feed-forward networks. In this work we propose a simple method to address this issue. The proposed method poses the learning of weights in deep networks as a constrained optimization problem where the presence of skip-connections is penalized by Lagrange multipliers. This allows for skip-connections to be introduced during the early stages of training and subsequently phased out in a principled manner. We demonstrate the benefits of such an approach with experiments on MNIST, fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 where the proposed method is shown to greatly decrease the degradation effect (compared to plain networks) and is often competitive with ResNets.",

Naive application of such algorithms on multiple source domain adaptation problem may lead to suboptimal solutions. We propose a new generalization bound for domain adaptation when there are multiple source domains with labeled instances and one target domain with unlabeled instances. Compared with existing bounds, the new bound does not require expert knowledge about the target distribution, nor the optimal combination rule for multisource domains. Interestingly, our theory also leads to an efficient learning strategy using adversarial neural networks: we show how to interpret it as learning feature representations that are invariant to the multiple domain shifts while still being discriminative for the learning task. To this end, we propose two models, both of which we call multisource domain adversarial networks (MDANs): the first model optimizes directly our bound, while the second model is a smoothed approximation of the first one, leading to a more data-efficient and task-adaptive model. The optimization tasks of both models are minimax saddle point problems that can be optimized by adversarial training. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MDANs, we conduct extensive experiments showing superior adaptation performance on three real-world datasets: sentiment analysis, digit classification, and vehicle counting. \n",

In this paper, we provide a quantitative analysis of the robustness of classifiers to universal perturbations, and draw a formal link between the robustness to universal perturbations, and the geometry of the decision boundary. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the robustness of classifiers under two decision boundary models (flat and curved models). We show in particular that the robustness of deep networks to universal perturbations is driven by a key property of their curvature: there exist shared directions along which the decision boundary of deep networks is systematically positively curved. Under such conditions, we prove the existence of small universal perturbations.

Different from traditional learning algorithms where features are pre-defined and only weight vectors are tunable through training, feature vectors are also tunable as representation learning in deep learning. Thus we investigate how to improve the classification performance by better adjusting the features. One main observation is that elongating the feature norm of both correctly-classified and mis-classified feature vectors improves learning: (1) increasing the feature norm of correctly-classified examples induce smaller training loss; (2) increasing the feature norm of mis-classified examples can upweight the contribution from hard examples. Accordingly, we propose feature incay to regularize representation learning by encouraging larger feature norm. In contrast to weight decay which shrinks the weight norm, feature incay is proposed to stretch the feature norm. Extensive empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and LFW demonstrate the effectiveness of feature incay. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing a two-layer artificial neural network that best fits a training dataset. We look at this problem in the setting where the number of parameters is greater than the number of sampled points. We show that for a wide class of differentiable activation functions (this class involves most nonlinear functions and excludes piecewise linear functions), we have that arbitrary first-order optimal solutions satisfy global optimality provided the hidden layer is non-singular. We essentially show that these non-singular hidden layer matrix satisfy a ``\"good\" property for these big class of activation functions. Techniques involved in proving this result inspire us to look at a new algorithmic, where in between two gradient step of hidden layer, we add a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) step of the output layer. In this new algorithmic framework, we extend our earlier result and show that for all finite iterations the hidden layer satisfies the``good\" property mentioned earlier therefore partially explaining success of noisy gradient methods and addressing the issue of data independency of our earlier result. Both of these results are easily extended to hidden layers given by a flat matrix from that of a square matrix. Results are applicable even if network has more than one hidden layer provided all inner hidden layers are arbitrary, satisfy non-singularity, all activations are from the given class of differentiable functions and optimization is only with respect to the outermost hidden layer. Separately, we also study the smoothness properties of the objective function and show that it is actually Lipschitz smooth, i.e., its gradients do not change sharply.

    "abstract": "Residual networks (Resnets) have become a prominent architecture in deep learning. However, a comprehensive understanding of Resnets is still a topic of ongoing research. A recent view argues that Resnets perform iterative refinement of features. We attempt to further expose properties of this aspect. To this end, we study Resnets both analytically and empirically. We formalize the notion of iterative refinement in Resnets by showing that residual architectures naturally encourage features to move along the negative gradient of loss during the feedforward phase. In addition, our empirical analysis suggests that Resnets are able to perform both representation learning and iterative refinement. In general, a Resnet block tends to concentrate representation learning behavior in the first few layers while higher layers perform iterative refinement of features. Finally we observe that sharing residual layers naively leads to representation explosion and hurts generalization performance, and show that simple existing strategies can help alleviating this problem.",

Progress in coding theory is largely driven by individual human ingenuity with sporadic breakthroughs over the past century. In this paper we study whether it is possible to automate the discovery of coding and decoding algorithms via deep learning. We study a family of sequential codes parametrized by recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. We show that creatively designed and trained RNN architectures can decode well known sequential codes such as the convolutional and turbo codes with close to optimal performance on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, which itself is achieved by breakthrough algorithms of our times (Viterbi and BCJR decoders, representing dynamic programing and forward-backward algorithms). We also show strong generalizations: we train at a specific signal to noise ratio and block length but test at a wide range of these quantities, and also demonstrate robustness and adaptivity to deviations from the AWGN setting. Finally, we use the RNN architectures to design new nonlinear codes that represent a major progress in the long standing open problem of communicating reliably over the AWGN channel with noisy output feedback.",

    "abstract": "Our work addresses two important issues with recurrent neural networks: (1) they are over-parameterized, and (2) the recurrent weight matrix is ill-conditioned. The former increases the sample complexity of learning and the training time. The latter causes the vanishing and exploding gradient problem. We present a flexible recurrent neural network model called Kronecker Recurrent Units (KRU). KRU achieves parameter efficiency in RNNs through a Kronecker factored recurrent matrix. It overcomes the ill-conditioning of the recurrent matrix by enforcing soft unitary constraints on the factors. Thanks to the small dimensionality of the factors, maintaining these constraints is computationally efficient. Our experimental results on seven standard data-sets reveal that KRU can reduce the number of parameters by three orders of magnitude in the recurrent weight matrix compared to the existing recurrent models, without trading the statistical performance. These results in particular show that while there are advantages in having a high dimensional recurrent space, the capacity of the recurrent part of the model can be dramatically reduced.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Bayesian methods have the potential to unify many related tasks (e.g. k-shot classification, conditional, and unconditional generation) by framing each as inference within a single generative model. We show that existing approaches for learning such models can fail on expressive generative networks such as PixelCNNs, by describing the global distribution with little reliance on latent variables. To address this, we develop a modification of the Variational Autoencoder in which encoded observations are decoded to new elements from the same class; the result, which we call a Variational Homoencoder (VHE), may be understood as training a hierarchical latent variable model which better utilises latent variables in these cases. Using this framework enables us to train a hierarchical PixelCNN for the Omniglot dataset, outperforming all existing models on test set likelihood. With a single model we achieve both strong one-shot generation and near human-level classification, competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers. The VHE objective extends naturally to richer dataset structures such as factorial or hierarchical categories, as we illustrate by training models to separate character content from simple variations in drawing style, and to generalise the style of an alphabet to new characters.",

We show that in a large class of games good strategies can be constructed by conditioning one's behavior solely on outcomes (ie. one's past rewards). We call this consequentialist conditional cooperation. We show how to construct such strategies using deep reinforcement learning techniques and demonstrate, both analytically and experimentally, that they are effective in social dilemmas beyond simple matrix games.

    "abstract": "Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven to be a powerful, general tool for learning complex behaviors. However, its sample efficiency is often impractically large for solving challenging real-world problems, even for off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning. A limiting factor in classic model-free RL is that the learning signal consists only of scalar rewards, ignoring much of the rich information contained in state transition tuples. Model-based RL uses this information, by training a predictive model, but often does not achieve the same asymptotic performance as model-free RL due to model bias. We introduce temporal difference models (TDMs), a family of goal-conditioned value functions that can be trained with model-free learning and used for model-based control. TDMs combine the benefits of model-free and model-based RL: they leverage the rich information in state transitions to learn very efficiently, while still attaining asymptotic performance that exceeds that of direct model-based RL methods. Our experimental results show that, on a range of continuous control tasks, TDMs provide a substantial improvement in efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-based and model-free methods.",

We propose a simpler and novel update scheme to maintain orthogonal recurrent weight matrices without using complex valued matrices.

Such a parametrization is unable to represent matrices with negative one eigenvalues, but this limitation is overcome by scaling the recurrent weight matrix by a diagonal matrix consisting of ones and negative ones.

We describe a version of capsules in which each capsule has a logistic unit to represent the presence of an entity and a 4x4 matrix which could learn to represent the relationship between that entity and the viewer (the pose). A capsule in one layer votes for the pose matrix of many different capsules in the layer above by multiplying its own pose matrix by trainable viewpoint-invariant transformation matrices that could learn to represent part-whole relationships. Each of these votes is weighted by an assignment coefficient. These coefficients are iteratively updated for each image using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm such that the output of each capsule is routed to a capsule in the layer above that receives a cluster of similar votes. The transformation matrices are trained discriminatively by backpropagating through the unrolled iterations of EM between each pair of adjacent capsule layers.

    "abstract": "Model pruning has become a useful technique that improves the computational efficiency of deep learning, making it possible to deploy solutions on resource- limited scenarios. A widely-used practice in relevant work assumes that a smaller- norm parameter or feature plays a less informative role at the inference time. In this paper, we propose a channel pruning technique for accelerating the computations of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which does not critically rely on this assumption. Instead, it focuses on direct simplification of the channel-to-channel computation graph of a CNN without the need of performing a computational difficult and not always useful task of making high-dimensional tensors of CNN structured sparse. Our approach takes two stages: the first being to adopt an end-to-end stochastic training method that eventually forces the outputs of some channels being constant, and the second being to prune those constant channels from the original neural network by adjusting the biases of their impacting layers such that the resulting compact model can be quickly fine-tuned. Our approach is mathematically appealing from an optimization perspective and easy to reproduce. We experimented our approach through several image learning benchmarks and demonstrate its interesting aspects and the competitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) were introduced to combat vanishing gradients in simple recurrent neural networks (S-RNNs) by augmenting them with additive recurrent connections controlled by gates. We present an alternate view to explain the success of LSTMs: the gates themselves are powerful recurrent models that provide more representational power than previously appreciated. We do this by showing that the LSTM's gates can be decoupled from the embedded S-RNN, producing a restricted class of RNNs where the main recurrence computes an element-wise weighted sum of context-independent functions of the inputs. Experiments on a range of challenging NLP problems demonstrate that the simplified gate-based models work substantially better than S-RNNs, and often just as well as the original LSTMs, strongly suggesting that the gates are doing much more in practice than just alleviating vanishing gradients.",

Specifically, the limit of VAF detection is closely related to the depth of coverage, due to the requirement of multiple supporting reads in extant methods, precluding the detection of mutations at VAFs that are orders of magnitude lower than the depth of coverage. Nevertheless, the ability to detect cancer-associated mutations in ultra low VAFs is a fundamental requirement for low-tumor burden cancer diagnostics applications such as early detection, monitoring, and therapy nomination using liquid biopsy methods (cell-free DNA). Here we defined a spatial representation of sequencing information adapted for convolutional architecture that enables variant detection at VAFs, in a manner independent of the depth of sequencing. This method enables the detection of cancer mutations even in VAFs as low as 10x-4^, &gt;2 orders of magnitude below the current state-of-the-art.

Today, neural networks can learn multiple tasks when trained on them jointly, but cannot maintain performance on learnt tasks when tasks are presented one at a time -- this phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting is a fundamental challenge to overcome before neural networks can learn continually from incoming data. In this work, we derive inspiration from human memory to develop an architecture capable of learning continuously from sequentially incoming tasks, while averting catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, our model consists of a dual memory architecture to emulate the complementary learning systems (hippocampus and the neocortex) in the human brain and maintains a consolidated long-term memory via generative replay of past experiences. We (i) substantiate our claim that replay should be generative, (ii) show the benefits of generative replay and dual memory via experiments, and (iii) demonstrate improved performance retention even for small models with low capacity. Our architecture displays many important characteristics of the human memory and provides insights on the connection between sleep and learning in humans.",

Solving this subproblem is non-trivial---existing methods have only sub-linear convergence rate. In the first part, we show that a simple modification of gradient descent algorithm can converge to a global minimizer of the subproblem with an asymptotic linear convergence rate. Moreover, our method only requires Hessian-vector products, which can be computed efficiently by back-propagation in neural networks. In the second part, we apply our algorithm to train large-scale convolutional neural networks, such as VGG and MobileNets. Although trust region method is about 3 times slower than SGD in terms of running time, we observe it finds a model that has lower generalization (test) error than SGD, and this difference is even more significant in large batch training. \nWe conduct several interesting experiments to support our conjecture that the trust region method can avoid sharp local minimas.",

Our regularizer guides the rectifier discriminator D to better allocate its model capacity, by encouraging the binary activation patterns on selected internal layers of D to have a high joint entropy. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real datasets demonstrate improvements in stability and convergence speed of the GAN training, as well as higher sample quality.

We show that for autoencoder configurations with both differentiable (e.g. sigmoid) and non-differentiable (e.g. ReLU) activation functions, we can perform the alternations very effectively. DANTE effortlessly extends to networks with multiple hidden layers and varying network configurations.

Two of its major limitations are scalability and generalization of the spectral embedding (i.e., out-of-sample-extension). In this paper we introduce a deep learning approach to spectral clustering that overcomes the above shortcomings. Our network, which we call SpectralNet, learns a map that embeds input data points into the eigenspace of their associated graph Laplacian matrix and subsequently clusters them. We train SpectralNet using a procedure that involves constrained stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization allows it to scale to large datasets, while the constraints, which are implemented using a special purpose output layer, allow us to keep the network output orthogonal. Moreover, the map learned by SpectralNet naturally generalizes the spectral embedding to unseen data points. To further improve the quality of the clustering, we replace the standard pairwise Gaussian affinities with affinities leaned from unlabeled data using a Siamese network.  Additional improvement can be achieved by applying the network to code representations produced, e.g., by standard autoencoders. Our end-to-end learning procedure is fully unsupervised. In addition, we apply VC dimension theory to derive a lower bound on the size of  SpectralNet.  State-of-the-art clustering results are reported for both the MNIST and Reuters datasets.\n",

    "abstract": "Attention models have been intensively studied to improve NLP tasks such as machine comprehension via both question-aware passage attention model and self-matching attention model. Our research proposes phase conductor (PhaseCond) for attention models in two meaningful ways. First, PhaseCond, an architecture of multi-layered attention models, consists of multiple phases each implementing a stack of attention layers producing passage representations and a stack of inner or outer fusion layers regulating the information flow.  Second, we extend and improve the dot-product attention function for PhaseCond by simultaneously encoding multiple question and passage embedding layers from different perspectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model PhaseCond on the SQuAD dataset, showing that our model significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art single-layered and multiple-layered attention models. We deepen our results with new findings via both detailed qualitative analysis and visualized examples showing the dynamic changes through multi-layered attention models.",

    "abstract": "Conventional methods model open domain dialogue generation as a black box through end-to-end learning from large scale conversation data. In this work, we make the first step to open the black box by introducing dialogue acts into open domain dialogue generation. The dialogue acts are generally designed and reveal how people engage in social chat. Inspired by analysis on real data, we propose jointly modeling dialogue act selection and response generation, and perform learning with human-human conversations tagged with a dialogue act classifier and a reinforcement approach to further optimizing the model for long-term conversation. With the dialogue acts, we not only achieve significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods on response quality for given contexts and long-term conversation in both machine-machine simulation and human-machine conversation, but also are capable of explaining why such achievements can be made.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used in state-of-the-art models in domains such as speech recognition, machine translation, and language modelling. Sparsity is a technique to reduce compute and memory requirements of deep learning models. Sparse RNNs are easier to deploy on devices and high-end server processors. Even though sparse operations need less compute and memory relative to their dense counterparts, the speed-up observed by using sparse operations is less than expected on different hardware platforms. In order to address this issue, we investigate two different approaches to induce block sparsity in RNNs: pruning blocks of weights in a layer and using group lasso regularization with pruning to create blocks of weights with zeros. Using these techniques, we can create block-sparse RNNs with sparsity ranging from 80% to 90% with a small loss in accuracy. This technique allows us to reduce the model size by roughly 10x. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to recover this loss in accuracy while maintaining high block sparsity and reducing the overall parameter count. Our technique works with a variety of block sizes up to 32x32. Block-sparse RNNs eliminate overheads related to data storage and irregular memory accesses while increasing hardware efficiency compared to unstructured sparsity.\n",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in recurrent neural nets (RNNs) have shown much promise in many applications in natural language processing. For most of these tasks, such as sentiment analysis of customer reviews, a recurrent neural net model parses the entire review before forming a decision. We argue that reading the entire input is not always necessary in practice, since a lot of reviews are often easy to classify, i.e., a decision can be formed after reading some crucial sentences or words in the provided text. In this paper, we present an approach of fast reading for text classification. Inspired by several well-known human reading techniques, our approach implements an intelligent recurrent agent which evaluates the importance of the current snippet in order to decide whether to make a prediction, or to skip some texts, or to re-read part of the sentence. Our agent uses an RNN module to encode information from the past and the current tokens, and applies a policy module to form decisions. With an end-to-end training algorithm based on policy gradient, we train and test our agent on several text classification datasets and achieve both higher efficiency and better accuracy compared to previous approaches. \n",

    "abstract": "Vanishing and exploding gradients are two of the main obstacles in training deep neural networks, especially in capturing long range dependencies in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In this paper, we present an efficient parametrization of the transition matrix of an RNN that allows us to stabilize the gradients that arise in its training. Specifically, we parameterize the transition matrix by its singular value decomposition (SVD), which allows us to explicitly track and control its singular values. We attain efficiency by using tools that are common in numerical linear algebra, namely Householder reflectors for representing the orthogonal matrices that arise in the SVD. By explicitly controlling the singular values, our proposed svdRNN method allows us to easily solve the exploding gradient problem and we observe that it empirically solves the vanishing gradient issue to a large extent. We note that the SVD parameterization can be used for any rectangular weight matrix, hence it can be easily extended to any deep neural network, such as a multi-layer perceptron. Theoretically, we demonstrate that our parameterization does not lose any expressive power, and show how it potentially makes the optimization process easier. Our extensive  experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed framework converges faster, and has good generalization, especially when the depth is large. \n",

We propose a new notion of action value defined by a Gaussian smoothed version of the expected Q-value used in SARSA. We show that such smoothed Q-values still satisfy a Bellman equation, making them naturally learnable from experience sampled from an environment. Moreover, the gradients of expected reward with respect to the mean and covariance of a parameterized Gaussian policy can be recovered from the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value function. Based on these relationships we develop new algorithms for training a Gaussian policy directly from a learned Q-value approximator. The approach is also amenable to proximal optimization techniques by augmenting the objective with a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy. We find that the ability to learn both a mean and covariance during training allows this approach to achieve strong results on standard continuous control benchmarks.",

Besides, they have also been applied to supervised learning tasks that decode text, e.g., automatic speech recognition (ASR). By re-scoring the n-best list, NLM can select grammatically more correct candidate among the list, and significantly reduce word/char error rate. However, the generative nature of NLM may not guarantee a discrimination between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d (in a task-specific sense) sentences, resulting in suboptimal performance. This work proposes an approach to adapt a generative NLM to a discriminative one. Different from the commonly used maximum likelihood objective, the proposed method aims at enlarging the margin between the \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d sentences. It is trained end-to-end and can be widely applied to tasks that involve the re-scoring of the decoded text.

However, by performing targeted optimization to learn generative models with different rates, we are able to learn many models that can achieve similar generative performance but make vastly different trade-offs in terms of the usage of the latent variable.

    "abstract": "Designing a metric manually for unsupervised sequence generation tasks, such as text generation, is essentially difficult. In a such situation, learning a metric of a sequence from data is one possible solution. The previous study, SeqGAN, proposed the framework for unsupervised sequence generation, in which a metric is learned from data, and a generator is optimized with regard to the learned metric with policy gradient, inspired by generative adversarial nets (GANs) and reinforcement learning. In this paper, we make two proposals to learn better metric than SeqGAN's: partial reward function and expert-based reward function training. The partial reward function is a reward function for a partial sequence of a certain length. SeqGAN employs a reward function for completed sequence only. By combining long-scale and short-scale partial reward functions, we expect a learned metric to be able to evaluate a partial correctness as well as a coherence of a sequence, as a whole. In expert-based reward function training, a reward function is trained to discriminate between an expert (or true) sequence and a fake sequence that is produced by editing an expert sequence. Expert-based reward function training is not a kind of GAN frameworks. This makes the optimization of the generator easier. We examine the effect of the partial reward function and expert-based reward function training on synthetic data and real text data, and show improvements over SeqGAN and the model trained with MLE. Specifically, whereas SeqGAN gains 0.42 improvement of NLL over MLE on synthetic data, our best model gains 3.02 improvement, and whereas SeqGAN gains 0.029 improvement of BLEU over MLE, our best model gains 0.250 improvement.",

We introduce minimax curriculum learning (MCL), which trains a model on a diverse few samples at first, and then later on a larger training set containing concentrated hard samples, thereby avoiding wasted efforts on redundant samples in early stages and on disperse outliers in later stages. At each stage, model weights and training sets are updated by solving a minimax optimization, whose objective is composed of a loss (reflecting the hardness of the training set) and a submodular regularization (measuring its diversity). MCL repeatedly solves a sequence of such optimizations with decreasing diversity and increasing training set size. Unlike the expensive alternative minimization used in previous work, we reduce MCL to minimization of a surrogate function that can be handled by submodular maximization and optimized by gradient methods. We show that MCL achieves better performance by using fewer labeled samples for both shallow and deep models.",

    "abstract": "Despite being impactful on a  variety of problems and applications, the generative adversarial nets (GANs) are remarkably difficult to train. This issue is formally analyzed by \\cite{arjovsky2017towards}, who also propose an alternative direction to avoid the caveats in the minmax two-player training of GANs. The corresponding algorithm, namely, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) hinges on the 1-Lipschitz continuity of the discriminators. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for enforcing the Lipschitz continuity in the training procedure of WGANs. Our approach seamlessly connects WGAN with one of the recent semi-supervised learning approaches. As  a result, it gives rise to not only better photo-realistic samples  than the previous methods  but also state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning results.  In particular, to the best of our knowledge, our approach gives rise to the inception score of more than 5.0 with only 1,000 CIFAR10 images and is the first that exceeds the accuracy of 90\\% the CIFAR10 datasets using only 4,000 labeled images.\n",

    "abstract": "In this work we explore a straightforward variational Bayes scheme for Recurrent Neural Networks.\nFirstly, we show that a simple adaptation of truncated backpropagation through time can yield good quality uncertainty estimates and superior regularisation at only a small extra computational cost during training, also reducing the amount of parameters by 80\\%.\nSecondly, we demonstrate how a novel kind of posterior approximation yields further improvements to the performance of Bayesian RNNs. We incorporate local gradient information into the approximate posterior to sharpen it around the current batch statistics. We show how this technique is not exclusive to recurrent neural networks and can be applied more widely to train Bayesian neural networks.\nWe also empirically demonstrate how Bayesian RNNs are superior to traditional RNNs on a language modelling benchmark and an image captioning task, as well as showing how each of these methods improve our model over a variety of other schemes for training them. We also introduce a new benchmark for studying uncertainty for language models so future methods can be easily compared.",

    "abstract": "Progress in probabilistic generative models has accelerated, developing richer models with neural architectures, implicit densities, and with scalable algorithms for their Bayesian inference. However, there has been limited progress in models that capture causal relationships, for example, how individual genetic factors cause major human diseases. In this work, we focus on two challenges in particular: How do we build richer causal models, which can capture highly nonlinear relationships and interactions between multiple causes? How do we adjust for latent confounders, which are variables influencing both cause and effect and which prevent learning of causal relationships? To address these challenges, we synthesize ideas from causality and modern probabilistic modeling. For the first, we describe implicit causal models, a class of causal models that leverages neural architectures with an implicit density. For the second, we describe an implicit causal model that adjusts for confounders by sharing strength across examples. In experiments, we scale Bayesian inference on up to a billion genetic measurements. We achieve state of the art accuracy for identifying causal factors: we significantly outperform the second best result by an absolute difference of 15-45.3%.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the simplicity of learned neural networks under various settings: learned on real vs random data, varying size/architecture and using large minibatch size vs small minibatch size. The notion of simplicity used here is that of learnability i.e., how accurately can the prediction function of a neural network be learned from labeled samples from it. While learnability is different from (in fact often higher than) test accuracy, the results herein suggest that there is a strong correlation between small generalization errors and high learnability.\nThis work also shows that there exist significant qualitative differences in shallow networks as compared to popular deep networks. More broadly, this paper extends in a new direction, previous work on understanding the properties of learned neural networks. Our hope is that such an empirical study of understanding learned neural networks might shed light on the right assumptions that can be made for a theoretical study of deep learning.",

We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator.

To address this challenge, we first show iteratively generated adversarial images easily transfer between networks trained with the same strategy. Inspired by this observation, we propose cascade adversarial training, which transfers the knowledge of the end results of adversarial training. We train a network from scratch by injecting iteratively generated adversarial images crafted from already defended networks in addition to one-step adversarial images from the network being trained. We also propose to utilize embedding space for both classification and low-level (pixel-level) similarity learning to ignore unknown pixel level perturbation. During training, we inject adversarial images without replacing their corresponding clean images and penalize the distance between the two embeddings (clean and adversarial). Experimental results show that cascade adversarial training together with our proposed low-level similarity learning efficiently enhances the robustness against iterative attacks, but at the expense of decreased robustness against one-step attacks. We show that combining those two techniques can also improve robustness under the worst case black box attack scenario.",

In particular, the recent DenseNet is efficient in computation and parameters, and achieves state-of-the-art predictions by directly connecting each feature layer to all previous ones. However, DenseNet's extreme connectivity pattern may hinder its scalability to high depths, and in applications like fully convolutional networks, full DenseNet connections are prohibitively expensive. \nThis work first experimentally shows that one key advantage of skip connections is to have short distances among feature layers during backpropagation. Specifically, using a fixed number of skip connections, the connection patterns with shorter backpropagation distance among layers have more accurate predictions. Following this insight, we propose a connection template, Log-DenseNet, which, in comparison to DenseNet,  only slightly increases the backpropagation distances among layers from 1 to  ($1 + \\log_2 L$), but uses only $L\\log_2 L$ total connections instead of $O(L^2)$. Hence, \\logdenses are easier to scale than DenseNets, and no longer require careful GPU memory management. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design principle by showing better performance than DenseNets on tabula rasa semantic segmentation, and competitive results on visual recognition.",

    "abstract": "Due to the substantial computational cost, training state-of-the-art deep neural networks for large-scale datasets often requires distributed training using multiple computation workers. However, by nature, workers need to frequently communicate gradients, causing severe bottlenecks, especially on lower bandwidth connections. A few methods have been proposed to compress gradient for efficient communication, but they either suffer a low compression ratio or significantly harm the resulting model accuracy, particularly when applied to convolutional neural networks. To address these issues, we propose a method to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning. Our key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous (high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated. We also present an efficient algorithm to compute the variance and prove that it can be obtained with negligible additional cost. We experimentally show that our method can achieve very high compression ratio while maintaining the result model accuracy. We also analyze the efficiency using computation and communication cost models and provide the evidence that this method enables distributed deep learning for many scenarios with commodity environments.",

    "abstract": "To overcome the limitations of Neural Programmer-Interpreters (NPI) in its universality and learnability, we propose the incorporation of combinator abstraction into neural programing and a new NPI architecture to support this abstraction, which we call Combinatory Neural Programmer-Interpreter (CNPI). Combinator abstraction dramatically reduces the number and complexity of programs that need to be interpreted by the core controller of CNPI, while still allowing the CNPI to represent and interpret arbitrary complex programs by the collaboration of the core with the other components. We propose a small set of four combinators to capture the most pervasive programming patterns. Due to the finiteness and simplicity of this combinator set and the offloading of some burden of interpretation from the core, we are able construct a CNPI that is universal with respect to the set of all combinatorizable programs, which is adequate for solving most algorithmic tasks. Moreover, besides supervised training on execution traces, CNPI can be trained by policy gradient reinforcement learning with appropriately designed curricula.",

    "abstract": "We propose an end-to-end-trainable attention module for convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures built for image classification. The module takes as input the 2D feature vector maps which form the intermediate representations of the input image at different stages in the CNN pipeline, and outputs a 2D matrix of scores for each map. Standard CNN architectures are modified through the incorporation of this module, and trained under the constraint that a convex combination of the intermediate 2D feature vectors, as parametrised by the score matrices, must alone be used for classification. Incentivised to amplify the relevant and suppress the irrelevant or misleading, the scores thus assume the role of attention values. Our experimental observations provide clear evidence to this effect: the learned attention maps neatly highlight the regions of interest while suppressing background clutter. Consequently, the proposed function is able to bootstrap standard CNN architectures for the task of image classification, demonstrating superior generalisation over 6 unseen benchmark datasets. When binarised, our attention maps outperform other CNN-based attention maps, traditional saliency maps, and top object proposals for weakly supervised segmentation as demonstrated on the Object Discovery dataset. We also demonstrate improved robustness against the fast gradient sign method of adversarial attack.",

The complementary strengths of these approaches,  to model global and local image statistics respectively, suggest hybrid models combining the strengths of both models. Our contribution is to train such hybrid models using an auxiliary loss function that controls which information is captured by the latent variables and what is left to the autoregressive decoder. In contrast, prior work on such hybrid models needed to limit the capacity of the autoregressive decoder to prevent degenerate models that ignore the latent variables and only rely on autoregressive modeling. Our approach results in models with meaningful latent variable representations, and which rely on powerful autoregressive decoders to model image details.

These games have a number of appealing features: they are challenging for current learning approaches, but they form (i) a low-dimensional, simply parametrized environment where (ii) there is a linear closed form solution for optimal behavior from any state, and (iii) the difficulty of the game can be tuned by changing environment parameters in an interpretable way. We use these Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer games not only to compare different algorithms, but also to compare approaches based on supervised and reinforcement learning, to analyze the power of multi-agent approaches in improving performance, and to evaluate generalization to environments outside the training set.

This paper proposes a novel design of the adversary, {\\em multiple adversaries over random subspaces} (MARS) that instantiate the concept of the {\\em volunerableness}. The proposed method is motivated by an assumption that deceiving an adversary could fail to give meaningful information if the adversary is easily fooled, and adversary rely on single classifier suffer from this issues. \nIn contrast, the proposed method is designed to be less vulnerable, by utilizing the ensemble of independent classifiers where each classifier tries to predict sensitive variables from a different {\\em subset} of the representations. \nThe empirical validations on three user-anonymization tasks show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances in all three datasets without significantly harming the utility of data. \nThis is significant because it gives new implications about designing the adversary, which is important to improve the performance of AFL.

However, these approaches are difficult to optimize with gradient descent and they often do not converge well without careful hyperparameter tuning and proper initialization. We investigate whether turning the adversarial min-max problem into an optimization problem by replacing the maximization part with its dual improves the quality of the resulting alignment and explore its connections to Maximum Mean Discrepancy. Our empirical results suggest that using the dual formulation for the restricted family of linear discriminators results in a more stable convergence to a desirable solution when compared with the performance of a primal min-max GAN-like objective and an MMD objective under the same restrictions. We test our hypothesis on the problem of aligning two synthetic point clouds on a plane and on a real-image domain adaptation problem on digits. In both cases, the dual formulation yields an iterative procedure that gives more stable and monotonic improvement over time.",

Convergence problems during training are overcome by Wasserstein GANs which minimize the distance between the model and the empirical distribution in terms of a different metric, but thereby introduce a Lipschitz constraint into the optimization problem. A simple way to enforce the Lipschitz constraint on the class of functions, which can be modeled by the neural network, is weight clipping. Augmenting the loss by a regularization term that penalizes the deviation of the gradient norm of the critic (as a function of the network's input) from one, was proposed as an alternative that improves training. We present theoretical arguments why using a weaker regularization term enforcing the Lipschitz constraint is preferable. These arguments are supported by experimental results on several data sets.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have become the most successful and popular approach in many vision-related domains. While CNNs are particularly well-suited for capturing a proper hierarchy of concepts from real-world images, they are limited to domains where data is abundant. Recent attempts have looked into mitigating this data scarcity problem by casting their original single-task problem into a new multi-task learning (MTL) problem. The main goal of this inductive transfer mechanism is to leverage domain-specific information from related tasks, in order to improve generalization on the main task. While recent results in the deep learning (DL) community have shown the promising potential of training task-specific CNNs in a soft parameter sharing framework, integrating the recent DL advances for improving knowledge sharing is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose the Deep Collaboration Network (DCNet), a novel approach for connecting task-specific CNNs in a MTL framework. We define connectivity in terms of two distinct non-linear transformation blocks. One aggregates task-specific features into global features, while the other merges back the global features with each task-specific network. Based on the observation that task relevance depends on depth, our transformation blocks use skip connections as suggested by residual network approaches, to more easily deactivate unrelated task-dependent features. To validate our approach, we employed facial landmark detection (FLD) datasets as they are readily amenable to MTL, given the number of tasks they include. Experimental results show that we can achieve up to 24.31% relative improvement in landmark failure rate over other state-of-the-art MTL approaches. We finally perform an ablation study showing that our approach effectively allows knowledge sharing, by leveraging domain-specific features at particular depths from tasks that we know are related.",

GAC firstly learns a guide actor that locally maximizes the critic and then it updates the policy parameter based on the guide actor by supervised learning. Our main theoretical contributions are two folds. First, we show that GAC updates the guide actor by performing second-order optimization in the action space where the curvature matrix is based on the Hessians of the critic. Second, we show that the deterministic policy gradient method is a special case of GAC when the Hessians are ignored. Through experiments, we show that our method is a promising reinforcement learning method for continuous controls.\n",

    "abstract": "We investigate the training and performance of generative adversarial networks using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as critic, termed MMD GANs. As our main theoretical contribution, we clarify the situation with bias in GAN loss functions raised by recent work: we show that gradient estimators used in the optimization process for both MMD GANs and Wasserstein GANs are unbiased, but learning a discriminator based on samples leads to biased gradients for the generator parameters. We also discuss the issue of kernel choice for the MMD critic, and characterize the kernel corresponding to the energy distance used for the Cram\u00e9r GAN critic. Being an integral probability metric, the MMD benefits from training strategies recently developed for Wasserstein GANs. In experiments, the MMD GAN is able to employ a smaller critic network than the Wasserstein GAN, resulting in a simpler and faster-training algorithm with matching performance. We also propose an improved measure of GAN convergence, the Kernel Inception Distance, and show how to use it to dynamically adapt learning rates during GAN training.",

    "abstract": "We describe an approach to understand the peculiar and counterintuitive generalization properties of deep neural networks.  The approach involves going beyond worst-case theoretical capacity control frameworks that have been popular in machine learning in recent years to revisit old ideas in the statistical mechanics of neural networks.  Within this approach, we present a prototypical Very Simple Deep Learning (VSDL) model, whose behavior is controlled by two control parameters, one describing an effective amount of data, or load, on the network (that decreases when noise is added to the input), and one with an effective temperature interpretation (that increases when algorithms are early stopped).  Using this model, we describe how a very simple application of ideas from the statistical mechanics theory of generalization provides a strong qualitative description of recently-observed empirical results regarding the inability of deep neural networks not to overfit training data, discontinuous learning and sharp transitions in the generalization properties of learning algorithms, etc.",

Existing approaches conventionally learn full model parameters independently and then compress them via \\emph{ad hoc} processing such as model pruning or filter factorization. Alternatively, WSNet proposes learning model parameters by sampling from a compact set of learnable parameters, which naturally enforces {parameter sharing} throughout the learning process. We demonstrate that such a novel weight sampling approach (and induced WSNet) promotes both weights and computation sharing favorably. By employing this method, we can more efficiently learn much smaller networks with competitive performance compared to baseline networks with equal numbers of convolution filters. Specifically, we consider learning compact and efficient 1D convolutional neural networks for audio classification. Extensive experiments on multiple audio classification datasets verify the effectiveness of WSNet. Combined with weight quantization, the resulted models are up to \\textbf{180$\\times$} smaller and theoretically up to \\textbf{16$\\times$} faster than the well-established baselines, without noticeable performance drop.",

    "abstract": "Real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks consist of thousands of words that often represent many facts and entities. Existing models based on LSTMs require a large number of parameters to support external memory and do not generalize well for long sequence inputs. Memory networks attempt to address these limitations by storing information to an external memory module but must examine all inputs in the memory. Hence, for longer sequence inputs the intermediate memory components proportionally scale in size resulting in poor inference times and high computation costs.\n\nIn this paper, we present Adaptive Memory Networks (AMN) that process input question pairs to dynamically construct a network architecture optimized for lower inference times. During inference, AMN parses input text into entities within different memory slots. However, distinct from previous approaches, AMN is a dynamic network architecture that creates variable numbers of memory banks weighted by question relevance. Thus, the decoder can select a variable number of memory banks to construct an answer using fewer banks, creating a runtime trade-off between accuracy and speed. \n\nAMN is enabled by first, a novel bank controller that makes discrete decisions with high accuracy and second, the capabilities of a dynamic framework (such as PyTorch) that allow for dynamic network sizing and efficient variable mini-batching. In our results, we demonstrate that our model learns to construct a varying number of memory banks based on task complexity and achieves faster inference times for standard bAbI tasks, and modified bAbI tasks. We achieve state of the art accuracy over these tasks with an average 48% lower entities are examined during inference.",

    "abstract": "In practice it is often found that large over-parameterized neural networks generalize better than their smaller counterparts, an observation that appears to conflict with classical notions of function complexity, which typically favor smaller models. In this work, we investigate this tension between complexity and generalization through an extensive empirical exploration of two natural metrics of complexity related to sensitivity to input perturbations. Our experiments survey thousands of models with different architectures, optimizers, and other hyper-parameters, as well as four different image classification datasets.\n\nWe find that trained neural networks are more robust to input perturbations in the vicinity of the training data manifold, as measured by the input-output Jacobian of the network, and that this correlates well with generalization. We further establish that factors associated with poor generalization -- such as full-batch training or using random labels -- correspond to higher sensitivity, while factors associated with good generalization  -- such as data augmentation and ReLU non-linearities -- give rise to more robust functions. Finally, we demonstrate how the input-output Jacobian norm can be predictive of generalization at the level of individual test points.",

In this paper, we consider a realistic and more difficult sce- nario where a reinforcement learning agent only has access to the state sequences of an expert, while the expert actions are not available. Inferring the unseen ex- pert actions in a stochastic environment is challenging and usually infeasible when combined with a large state space. We propose a novel policy learning method which only utilizes the expert state sequences without inferring the unseen ac- tions. Specifically, our agent first learns to extract useful sub-goal information from the state sequences of the expert and then utilizes the extracted sub-goal information to factorize the action value estimate over state-action pairs and sub- goals. The extracted sub-goals are also used to synthesize guidance rewards in the policy learning. We evaluate our agent on five Doom tasks. Our empirical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the conventional DQN method.",

Learning representations for words in the ``long tail'' of this distribution requires enormous amounts of data. \nRepresentations of rare words trained directly on end tasks are usually poor, requiring us to pre-train embeddings on external data, or treat all rare words as out-of-vocabulary words with a unique representation. We provide a method for predicting embeddings of rare words on the fly from small amounts of auxiliary data with a network trained end-to-end for the downstream task.

    "abstract": "We consider two related questions at the heart of machine learning; how can we predict if a minimum will generalize to the test set, and why does stochastic gradient descent find minima that generalize well? Our work responds to Zhang et al. (2016), who showed deep neural networks can easily memorize randomly labeled training data, despite generalizing well on real labels of the same inputs. We show that the same phenomenon occurs in small linear models. These observations are explained by the Bayesian evidence, which penalizes sharp minima but is invariant to model parameterization. We also study how batch size influences test performance, observing an optimum batch size which maximizes the test set accuracy. We propose that the noise introduced by small mini-batches drives the parameters towards minima whose evidence is large. Interpreting stochastic gradient descent as a stochastic differential equation, we identify the ``noise scale\" $g = \\epsilon (\\frac{N}{B} - 1) \\approx \\epsilon N/B$, where $\\epsilon$ is the learning rate, $N$ training set size and $B$ batch size. Consequently the optimum batch size is proportional to the learning rate and the training set size, $B_{opt} \\propto \\epsilon N$. We verify these predictions empirically.",

This correspondence enables exact Bayesian inference for neural networks on regression tasks by means of straightforward matrix computations. For single hidden-layer networks, the covariance function of this GP has long been known. Recently, kernel functions for multi-layer random neural networks have been developed, but only outside of a Bayesian framework. As such, previous work has not identified the correspondence between using these kernels as the covariance function for a GP and performing fully Bayesian prediction with a deep neural network. In this work, we derive this correspondence and develop a computationally efficient pipeline to compute the covariance functions. We then use the resulting GP to perform Bayesian inference for deep neural networks on MNIST and CIFAR-10. We find that the GP-based predictions are competitive and can outperform neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent. We observe that the trained neural network accuracy approaches that of the corresponding GP-based computation with increasing layer width, and that the GP uncertainty is strongly correlated with prediction error. We connect our observations to the recent development of signal propagation in random neural networks.",

The nonlinearity of the generator implies that the latent space gives a distorted view of the input space. Under mild conditions, we show that this distortion can be characterized by a stochastic Riemannian metric, and we demonstrate that distances and interpolants are significantly improved under this metric. This in turn improves probability distributions, sampling algorithms and clustering in the latent space. Our geometric analysis further reveals that current generators provide poor variance estimates and we propose a new generator architecture with vastly improved variance estimates.

    "abstract": "Teaching an agent to navigate in an unseen 3D environment is a challenging task, even in the event of simulated environments. To generalize to unseen environments, an agent needs to be robust to low-level variations (e.g. color, texture, object changes), and also high-level variations (e.g. layout changes of the environment). To improve overall generalization, all types of variations in the environment have to be taken under consideration via different level of data augmentation steps. To this end, we propose House3D, a rich, extensible and efficient environment that contains 45,622 human-designed 3D scenes of visually realistic houses, ranging from single-room studios to multi-storied houses, equipped with a diverse set of fully labeled 3D objects, textures and scene layouts, based on the SUNCG dataset (Song et al., 2017). The diversity in House3D opens the door towards scene-level augmentation, while the label-rich nature of House3D enables us to inject pixel- &amp; task-level augmentations such as domain randomization (Tobin et al., 2017) and multi-task training. Using a subset of houses in House3D, we show that reinforcement learning agents trained with an enhancement of different levels of augmentations perform much better in unseen environments than our baselines with raw RGB input by over 8% in terms of navigation success rate.

    "abstract": "Methods for neural network hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling are computationally expensive due to the need to train a large number of model configurations. In this paper, we show that standard frequentist regression models can predict the final performance of partially trained model configurations using features based on network architectures, hyperparameters, and time series validation performance data. We empirically show that our performance prediction models are much more effective than prominent Bayesian counterparts, are simpler to implement, and are faster to train. Our models can predict final performance in both visual classification and language modeling domains, are effective for predicting performance of drastically varying model architectures, and can even generalize between model classes. Using these prediction models, we also propose an early stopping method for hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling, which obtains a speedup of a factor up to 6x in both hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling. Finally, we empirically show that our early stopping method can be seamlessly incorporated into both reinforcement learning-based architecture selection algorithms and bandit based search methods. Through extensive experimentation, we empirically show our performance prediction models and early stopping algorithm are state-of-the-art in terms of prediction accuracy and speedup achieved while still identifying the optimal model configurations.",

We provide a concrete metric for measuring the strength of such hierarchies, leading to an optimization problem for quickly reaching high reward on unseen tasks. We then present an algorithm to solve this problem end-to-end through the use of any off-the-shelf reinforcement learning method, by repeatedly sampling new tasks and resetting task-specific policies. We successfully discover meaningful motor primitives for the directional movement of four-legged robots, solely by interacting with distributions of mazes.

Even on toy problems, deep reinforcement learners periodically revisit these states, once they are forgotten under a new policy. In this paper, we introduce intrinsic fear, a learned reward shaping that accelerates deep reinforcement learning and guards oscillating policies against periodic catastrophes. Our approach incorporates a second model trained via supervised learning to predict the probability of imminent catastrophe. This score acts as a penalty on the Q-learning objective. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the perturbed objective yields the same average return under strong assumptions and an $\\epsilon$-close average return under weaker assumptions. Our analysis also shows robustness to classification errors. Equipped with intrinsic fear, our DQNs solve the toy environments and improve on the Atari games Seaquest, Asteroids, and Freeway.",

    "abstract": "While autoencoders are a key technique in representation learning for continuous structures, such as images or wave forms, developing general-purpose autoencoders for discrete structures, such as text sequence or discretized images, has proven to be more challenging. In particular, discrete inputs make it more difficult to learn a smooth encoder that preserves the complex local relationships in the input space. In this work, we propose an adversarially regularized autoencoder (ARAE) with the goal of learning more robust discrete-space representations. ARAE jointly trains both a rich discrete-space encoder, such as an RNN, and a simpler continuous space generator function, while using generative adversarial network (GAN) training to constrain the distributions to be similar. This method yields a smoother contracted code space that maps similar inputs to nearby codes, and also an implicit latent variable GAN model for generation. Experiments on text and discretized images demonstrate that the GAN model produces clean interpolations and captures the multimodality of the original space, and that the autoencoder produces improvements in semi-supervised learning as well as state-of-the-art results in unaligned text style transfer task using only a shared continuous-space representation.",

We take an orthogonal approach and introduce MIST RNNs, a NARX RNN architecture that allows direct connections from the very distant past. We show that MIST RNNs 1) exhibit superior vanishing-gradient properties in comparison to LSTM and previously-proposed NARX RNNs; 2) are far more efficient than previously-proposed NARX RNN architectures, requiring even fewer computations than LSTM; and 3) improve performance substantially over LSTM and Clockwork RNNs on tasks requiring very long-term dependencies.",

There, we show that the features learned by our model in an unsupervised way outperform the best handcrafted features.

Unlike computers, humans bring in a great deal of prior knowledge about the world, enabling efficient decision making. This paper investigates the role of human priors for solving video games. Given a sample game, we conduct a series of ablation studies to quantify the importance of various priors. We do this by modifying the video game environment to systematically mask different types of visual information that could be used by humans as priors. We find that removal of some prior knowledge causes a drastic degradation in the speed with which human players solve the game, e.g. from 2 minutes to over 20 minutes. Furthermore, our results indicate that general priors, such as the importance of objects and visual consistency, are critical for efficient game-play.",

    "abstract": "It has long been assumed that high dimensional continuous control problems cannot be solved effectively by discretizing individual dimensions of the action space due to the exponentially large number of bins over which policies would have to be learned. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the recent success of sequence-to-sequence models for structured prediction problems to develop policies over discretized spaces. Central to this method is the realization that complex functions over high dimensional spaces can be modeled by neural networks that predict one dimension at a time. Specifically, we show how Q-values and policies over continuous spaces can be modeled using a next step prediction model over discretized dimensions. With this parameterization, it is possible to both leverage the compositional structure of action spaces during learning, as well as compute maxima over action spaces (approximately). On a simple example task we demonstrate empirically that our method can perform global search, which effectively gets around the local optimization issues that plague DDPG. We apply the technique to off-policy (Q-learning) methods and show that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art for off-policy methods on several continuous control tasks.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in learning from demonstrations (LfD) with deep neural networks have enabled learning complex robot skills that involve high dimensional perception such as raw image inputs. \nLfD algorithms generally assume learning from single task demonstrations. In practice, however, it is more efficient for a teacher to demonstrate a multitude of tasks without careful task set up, labeling, and engineering. Unfortunately in such cases, traditional imitation learning techniques fail to represent the multi-modal nature of the data, and often result in sub-optimal behavior. In this paper we present an LfD approach for learning multiple modes of behavior from visual data. Our approach is based on a stochastic deep neural network (SNN), which represents the underlying intention in the demonstration as a stochastic activation in the network. We present an efficient algorithm for training SNNs, and for learning with vision inputs, we also propose an architecture that associates the intention with a stochastic attention module.\nWe demonstrate our method on real robot visual object reaching tasks, and show that\nit can reliably learn the multiple behavior modes in the demonstration data.

Recent advances in cross domain image mapping have concentrated on translating images across domains. Although the progress made is impressive, the visual fidelity many times does not suffice for identifying the matching sample from the other domain. In this paper, we tackle this very task of finding exact analogies between datasets i.e. for every image from domain A find an analogous image in domain B. We present a matching-by-synthesis approach: AN-GAN, and show that it outperforms current techniques. We further show that the cross-domain mapping task can be broken into two parts: domain alignment and learning the mapping function. The tasks can be iteratively solved, and as the alignment is improved, the unsupervised translation function reaches quality comparable to full supervision. ",

Specifically, we point out a blind-spot in recent studies in such ANNs: the importance of high final accuracy. In fact, we show on multiple recognition data-sets and architectures that by having near-optimal final predictions in small anytime models, we can effectively double the speed of large ones to reach corresponding accuracy level. We achieve such speed-up with simple weighting of anytime losses that oscillate during training. We also assemble a sequence of exponentially deepening ANNs, to achieve both theoretically and practically near-optimal anytime results at any budget, at the cost of a constant fraction of additional consumed budget.",

    "abstract": "The choice of activation functions in deep networks has a significant effect on the training dynamics and task performance. Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, f(x) = x * sigmoid(beta * x), which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network. ",

    "abstract": "Robust real-world  learning should benefit from both demonstrations and interaction with the environment. Current approaches to learning from demonstration and reward perform supervised learning on expert demonstration data and use reinforcement learning  to further improve performance based on reward from the environment. These tasks have divergent losses which are difficult to jointly optimize; further, such methods can be very sensitive to noisy demonstrations. We propose a unified reinforcement learning algorithm that effectively normalizes the Q-function, reducing the Q-values of actions unseen in the demonstration data.  Our Normalized Actor-Critic (NAC) method can learn from demonstration data of arbitrary quality and also leverages rewards from an interactive environment.  NAC learns an initial policy network from demonstration and refines the policy in a real environment. Crucially, both learning from demonstration and interactive refinement use exactly the same objective, unlike prior approaches that combine distinct supervised and reinforcement losses. This makes NAC robust to suboptimal demonstration data, since the method is not forced to mimic all of the examples in the dataset. We show that our unified reinforcement learning algorithm can learn robustly and  outperform existing baselines when evaluated on several realistic driving games.",

In contrast, system identification and model based planning in optimal control theory have a much more solid theoretical footing, where much is known with regards to their computational and statistical properties.  This work bridges this gap showing that (model free) policy gradient methods globally converge to the optimal solution and are efficient (polynomially so in relevant problem dependent quantities) with regards to their sample and computational complexities.

Such models encode features that can efficiently be used for classification and to transfer attributes between different images in image synthesis. As data we use a weakly labeled training set, where labels indicate what single factor has changed between two data samples, although the relative value of the change is unknown. This labeling is of particular interest as it may be readily available without annotation costs. We introduce an autoencoder model and train it through constraints on image pairs and triplets. We show the role of feature dimensionality and adversarial training theoretically and experimentally. We formally prove the existence of the reference ambiguity, which is inherently present in the disentangling task when weakly labeled data is used. The numerical value of a factor has different meaning in different reference frames. When the reference depends on other factors, transferring that factor becomes ambiguous. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed model can successfully transfer attributes on several datasets, but show also cases when the reference ambiguity occurs.\n",

This stochastic regularization has an effect of building an ensemble classifier out of combinatorial number of classifiers with different decision boundaries. Moreover, the learning of dropout probabilities for non-target classes on each instance allows the classifier to focus more on classification against the most confusing classes. We validate our model on multiple public datasets for classification, on which it obtains improved accuracy over regular softmax classifier and other baselines.

We argue that this imposes a limitation on their representation power, and instead propose a new general architecture for representing objects consisting of a hierarchy of parts, which we call Covariant Compositional Networks (CCNs). Here covariance means that the activation of each neuron must transform in a specific way under permutations, similarly to steerability in CNNs. We achieve covariance by making each activation transform according to a tensor representation of the permutation group, and derive the corresponding tensor aggregation rules that each neuron must implement. Experiments show that CCNs can outperform competing methods on some standard graph learning benchmarks. ",

Recently, generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) has successfully achieved it even on complex continuous control tasks. However, GAIL requires a huge number of interactions with environment during training. We believe that IL algorithm could be more applicable to the real-world environments if the number of interactions could be reduced. To this end, we propose a model free, off-policy IL algorithm for continuous control. The keys of our algorithm are two folds: 1) adopting deterministic policy that allows us to derive a novel type of policy gradient which we call deterministic policy imitation gradient (DPIG), 2) introducing a function which we call state screening function (SSF) to avoid noisy policy updates with states that are not typical of those appeared on the expert\u2019s demonstrations. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve the goal of IL with at least tens of times less interactions than GAIL on a variety of continuous control tasks.",

The techniques driving these advances, however, lack a formal method to account for model uncertainty. While the Bayesian approach to learning provides a solid theoretical framework to handle uncertainty, inference in Bayesian-inspired deep neural networks is difficult. In this paper, we provide a practical approach to Bayesian learning that relies on a regularization technique found in nearly every modern network, batch normalization. We show that training a deep network using batch normalization is equivalent to approximate inference in Bayesian models, and we demonstrate how this finding allows us to make useful estimates of the model uncertainty. Using our approach, it is possible to make meaningful uncertainty estimates using conventional architectures without modifying the network or the training procedure. Our approach is thoroughly validated in a series of empirical experiments on different tasks and using various measures, showing it to outperform baselines on a majority of datasets with strong statistical significance.",

A hallmark of RL algorithms is Temporal Difference (TD) learning: value function for the current state is moved towards a bootstrapped target that is estimated using the next state's value function. lambda-returns define the target of the RL agent as a weighted combination of rewards estimated by using multiple many-step look-aheads. Although mathematically tractable, the use of  exponentially decaying weighting of n-step returns based targets in lambda-returns is a rather ad-hoc design choice. Our major contribution  is that we propose a generalization of lambda-returns called Confidence-based Autodidactic Returns (CAR), wherein the RL agent learns the weighting of the n-step returns in an end-to-end manner. In contrast to lambda-returns wherein the RL agent is restricted to use an exponentially decaying weighting scheme, CAR allows the agent to learn to decide how much it wants to weigh the n-step returns based targets. Our experiments, in addition to showing the efficacy of CAR, also empirically demonstrate that using sophisticated weighted mixtures of multi-step returns (like CAR and lambda-returns) considerably outperforms the use of n-step returns. We perform our experiments on the  Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) algorithm in the Atari 2600 domain.",

However it remains challenging to capture the representations for discrete structures with formal grammars and semantics, e.g., computer programs and molecular structures. How to generate both syntactically and semantically correct data still remains largely an open problem. Inspired by the theory of compiler where syntax and semantics check is done via syntax-directed translation (SDT), we propose a novel syntax-directed variational autoencoder (SD-VAE) by introducing stochastic lazy attributes. This approach converts the offline SDT check into on-the-fly generated guidance for constraining the decoder. Comparing to the state-of-the-art methods, our approach enforces constraints on the output space so that the output will be not only syntactically valid, but also semantically reasonable. We evaluate the proposed model with applications in programming language and molecules, including reconstruction and program/molecule optimization. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in incorporating syntactic and semantic constraints in discrete generative models, which is significantly better than current state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "We provide a novel thinking of regularization neural networks. We smooth the objective of neural networks w.r.t small adversarial perturbations of the inputs. Different from previous works, we assume the adversarial perturbations are caused by the movement field. When the magnitude of movement field approaches 0, we call it virtual movement field. By introducing the movement field, we cast the problem of finding adversarial perturbations into the problem of finding adversarial movement field. By adding proper geometrical constraints to the movement field, such smoothness can be approximated in closed-form by solving a min-max problem and its geometric meaning is clear. We define the approximated smoothness as the regularization term.  We derive three regularization terms as running examples which measure the smoothness w.r.t shift, rotation and scale respectively by adding different constraints. We evaluate our methods on synthetic data, MNIST and CIFAR-10. Experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve the baseline neural networks. Compared with the state of the art regularization methods, proposed method achieves a tradeoff between accuracy and geometrical interpretability as well as computational cost.",

Conversation systems can be roughly divided into two categories: retrieval-based and generation-based systems. Retrieval systems search a user-issued utterance (namely a query) in a large conversational repository and return a reply that best matches the query. Generative approaches synthesize new replies. Both ways have certain advantages but suffer from their own disadvantages. We propose a novel ensemble of retrieval-based and generation-based conversation system. The retrieved candidates, in addition to the original query, are fed to a reply generator via a neural network, so that the model is aware of more information.

The explanations in the literature for the apparent effectiveness of shortcuts are varied and often contradictory. We hypothesize that shortcuts work primarily because they act as linear counterparts to nonlinear layers. We test this hypothesis by using several variations on the standard residual block, with different types of linear connections, to build small (100k--1.2M parameter) image classification networks. Our experiments show that other kinds of linear connections can be even more effective than the identity shortcuts. Our results also suggest that the best type of linear connection for a given application may depend on both network width and depth.",

Our model directly models underlying question logic using a recurrent controller that jointly predicts and executes functional neural modules; it explicitly forks subprocesses to handle logical branching.

We introduce an end-to-end differentiable model for interpreting questions, which is inspired by formal approaches to semantics. Each span of text is represented by a denotation in a knowledge graph, together with a vector that captures ungrounded aspects of meaning. Learned composition modules recursively combine constituents, culminating in a grounding for the complete sentence which is an answer to the question. For example, to interpret \u2018not green\u2019, the model will represent \u2018green\u2019 as a set of entities, \u2018not\u2019 as a trainable ungrounded vector, and then use this vector to parametrize a composition function to perform a complement operation. For each sentence, we build a parse chart subsuming all possible parses, allowing the model to jointly learn both the composition operators and output structure by gradient descent. We show the model can learn to represent a variety of challenging semantic operators, such as quantifiers, negation, disjunctions and composed relations on a synthetic question answering task. The model also generalizes well to longer sentences than seen in its training data, in contrast to LSTM and RelNet baselines. We will release our code.",

The discriminator set should be large enough to be able to uniquely identify the true distribution (discriminative), and also be small enough to go beyond memorizing samples (generalizable). In this paper, we show that a discriminator set is guaranteed to be discriminative whenever its linear span is dense in the set of bounded continuous functions. This is a very mild condition satisfied even by neural networks with a single neuron. Further, we develop generalization bounds between the learned distribution and true distribution under different evaluation metrics. When evaluated with neural distance, our bounds show that generalization is guaranteed as long as the discriminator set is small enough, regardless of the size of the generator or hypothesis set. When evaluated with KL divergence, our bound provides an explanation on the counter-intuitive behaviors of testing likelihood in GAN training. Our analysis sheds lights on understanding the practical performance of GANs.",

The encoding is based on the Bloomier filter, a probabilistic data structure that can save space at the cost of introducing random errors. Leveraging the ability of neural networks to tolerate these imperfections and by re-training around the errors, the proposed technique, Weightless, can compress DNN weights by up to 496x; with the same model accuracy, this results in up to a 1.51x improvement over the state-of-the-art.",

Typically this comparison is done either at the word level or at the sentence level, with no attempt to leverage the inherent structure of the sentence. When sentence structure is used for comparison, it is obtained during a non-differentiable pre-processing step, leading to propagation of errors. We introduce a model of structured alignments between sentences, showing how to compare two sentences by matching their latent structures. Using a structured attention mechanism, our model matches possible spans in the first sentence to possible spans in the second sentence, simultaneously discovering the tree structure of each sentence and performing a comparison, in a model that is fully differentiable and is trained only on the comparison objective. We evaluate this model on two sentence comparison tasks: the Stanford natural language inference dataset and the TREC-QA dataset. We find that comparing spans results in superior performance to comparing words individually, and that the learned trees are consistent with actual linguistic structures.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of semantic code repair, which can be broadly defined as automatically fixing non-syntactic bugs in source code. The majority of past work in semantic code repair assumed access to unit tests against which candidate repairs could be validated. In contrast, the goal here is to develop a strong statistical model to accurately predict both bug locations and exact fixes without access to information about the intended correct behavior of the program. Achieving such a goal requires a robust contextual repair model, which we train on a large corpus of real-world source code that has been augmented with synthetically injected bugs. Our framework adopts a two-stage approach where first a large set of repair candidates are generated by rule-based processors, and then these candidates are scored by a statistical model using a novel neural network architecture which we refer to as Share, Specialize, and Compete. Specifically, the architecture (1) generates a  shared encoding of the source code using an RNN over the abstract syntax tree, (2) scores each candidate repair using specialized network modules, and (3) then normalizes these scores together so they can compete against one another in comparable probability space. We evaluate our model on a real-world test set gathered from GitHub containing four common categories of bugs. Our model is able to predict the exact correct repair 41% of the time with a single guess, compared to 13% accuracy for an attentional sequence-to-sequence model.",

    "abstract": "Reward augmented maximum likelihood (RAML), a simple and effective learning framework to directly optimize towards the reward function in structured prediction tasks, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes. RAML incorporates task-specific reward by performing maximum-likelihood updates on candidate outputs sampled according to an exponentiated payoff distribution, which gives higher probabilities to candidates that are close to the reference output. While RAML is notable for its simplicity, efficiency, and its impressive empirical successes, the theoretical properties of RAML, especially the behavior of the exponentiated payoff distribution, has not been examined thoroughly. In this work, we introduce softmax Q-distribution estimation, a novel theoretical interpretation of RAML, which reveals the relation between RAML and Bayesian decision theory. The softmax Q-distribution can be regarded as a smooth approximation of the Bayes decision boundary, and the Bayes decision rule is achieved by decoding with this Q-distribution. We further show that RAML is equivalent to approximately estimating the softmax Q-distribution, with the temperature $\\tau$ controlling approximation error. We perform two experiments, one on synthetic data of multi-class classification and one on real data of image captioning, to demonstrate the relationship between RAML and the proposed softmax Q-distribution estimation, verifying our theoretical analysis. Additional experiments on three structured prediction tasks with rewards defined on sequential (named entity recognition), tree-based (dependency parsing) and irregular (machine translation) structures show notable improvements over maximum likelihood baselines.",

This paper takes an experimental approach, with a divide-and-conquer strategy in mind: we start by studying what happens in single neurons. While being the core building block of deep neural networks, the way they encode information about the inputs and how such encodings emerge is still unknown. We report experiments providing strong evidence that hidden neurons behave like binary classifiers during training and testing. During training, analysis of the gradients reveals that a neuron separates two categories of inputs, which are impressively constant across training. During testing, we show that the fuzzy, binary partition described above embeds the core information used by the network for its prediction. These observations bring to light some of the core internal mechanics of deep neural networks, and have the potential to guide the next theoretical and practical developments.",

However, algorithms that estimate state and state-action value functions typically assume a fully observed state and must compensate for partial or non-Markovian observations by using finite-length frame-history observations or recurrent networks. In this work, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on counterfactual regret minimization that iteratively updates an approximation to a cumulative clipped advantage function and is robust to partially observed state.

Decades of psychological research have yielded a variety of formal theories of categories, yet validating these theories with naturalistic stimuli remains a challenge. The problem is that human category representations cannot be directly observed and running informative experiments with naturalistic stimuli such as images requires having a workable representation of these stimuli. Deep neural networks have recently been successful in a range of computer vision tasks and provide a way to represent the features of images. In this paper, we introduce a method for estimating the structure of human categories that draws on ideas from both cognitive science and machine learning, blending human-based algorithms with state-of-the-art deep representation learners. We provide qualitative and quantitative results as a proof of concept for the feasibility of the method. Samples drawn from human distributions rival the quality of current state-of-the-art generative models and outperform alternative methods for estimating the structure of human categories.",

In the case of digital histopathological analysis, highly trained pathologists must review vast whole-slide-images of extreme digital resolution (100,000^2 pixels) across multiple zoom levels in order to locate abnormal regions of cells, or in some cases single cells, out of millions. The application of deep learning to this problem is hampered not only by small sample sizes, as typical datasets contain only a few hundred samples, but also by the generation of ground-truth localized annotations for training interpretable classification and segmentation models. We propose a method for disease available during training. Even without pixel-level annotations, we are able to demonstrate performance comparable with models trained with strong annotations on the Camelyon-16 lymph node metastases detection challenge. We accomplish this through the use of pre-trained deep convolutional networks, feature embedding, as well as learning via top instances and negative evidence, a multiple instance learning technique fromatp the field of semantic segmentation and object detection.",

However, optimizing RNNs is known to be harder compared to feed-forward neural networks. A number of techniques have been proposed in literature to address this problem. In this paper we propose a simple technique called fraternal dropout that takes advantage of dropout to achieve this goal. Specifically, we propose to train two identical copies of an RNN (that share parameters) with different dropout masks while minimizing the difference between their (pre-softmax) predictions. In this way our regularization encourages the representations of RNNs to be invariant to dropout mask, thus being robust. We show that our regularization term is upper bounded by the expectation-linear dropout objective which has been shown to address the gap due to the difference between the train and inference phases of dropout. We evaluate our model and achieve state-of-the-art results in sequence modeling tasks on two benchmark datasets - Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2. We also show that our approach leads to performance improvement by a significant margin in image captioning (Microsoft COCO) and semi-supervised (CIFAR-10) tasks.",

The controller is trained with policy gradient to select a path that maximizes the expected reward on the validation set. Meanwhile the model corresponding to the selected path is trained to minimize the cross entropy loss. On the Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS can discover a novel architecture thats achieves a test perplexity of 57.8, which is state-of-the-art among automatic model design methods on Penn Treebank. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ENAS can design novel architectures that achieve a test error of 2.89%, close to the 2.65% achieved by standard NAS (Zoph et al., 2017). Most importantly, our experiments show that ENAS is more than 10x faster and 100x less resource-demanding than NAS.",

We present an asynchronous model-parallel (AMP) training algorithm that is specifically motivated by training on networks of interconnected devices. Through an implementation on multi-core CPUs, we show that AMP training converges to the same accuracy as conventional synchronous training algorithms in a similar number of epochs, but utilizes the available hardware more efficiently, even for small minibatch sizes, resulting in shorter overall training times.

Using multiple networks trained independently to make predictions improves accuracy further. One obvious drawback of the ensembling technique is its higher execution cost during inference.% If we average 100 local predictions, the execution cost will be 100 times as high as the cost without the ensemble. This higher cost limits the real-world use of ensembling. In this paper, we first describe our insights on relationship between the probability of the prediction and the effect of ensembling with current deep neural networks; ensembling does not help mispredictions for inputs predicted with a high probability, i.e. the output from the softmax. This finding motivates us to develop a new technique called adaptive ensemble prediction, which achieves the benefits of ensembling with much smaller additional execution costs. Hence, we calculate the confidence level of the prediction for each input from the probabilities of the local predictions during the ensembling computation. If the prediction for an input reaches a high enough probability on the basis of the confidence level, we stop ensembling for this input to avoid wasting computation power. We evaluated the adaptive ensembling by using various datasets and showed that it reduces the computation cost significantly while achieving similar accuracy to the naive ensembling. We also showed that our statistically rigorous confidence-level-based termination condition reduces the burden of the task-dependent parameter tuning compared to the naive termination based on the pre-defined threshold in addition to yielding a better accuracy with the same cost.\n",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable results in the task of generating realistic natural images. In most applications, GAN models share two aspects in common. On the one hand, GANs training involves solving a challenging saddle point optimization problem, interpreted as an adversarial game between a generator and a discriminator functions. On the other hand, the generator and the discriminator are parametrized in terms of deep convolutional neural networks. The goal of this paper is to disentangle the contribution of these two factors to the success of GANs. In particular, we introduce Generative Latent Optimization (GLO), a framework to train deep convolutional generators without using discriminators, thus avoiding the instability of adversarial optimization problems. Throughout a variety of experiments, we show that GLO enjoys many of the desirable properties of GANs: learning from large data, synthesizing visually-appealing samples, interpolating meaningfully between samples, and performing linear arithmetic with noise vectors.",

    "abstract": "We propose a probabilistic framework for domain adaptation that blends both generative and discriminative modeling in a principled way. Under this framework, generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices of the prior over parameters. This provides us a very general way to interpolate between generative and discriminative extremes through different choices of priors. By maximizing both the marginal and the conditional log-likelihoods, models derived from this framework can use both labeled instances from the source domain as well as unlabeled instances from \\emph{both} source and target domains. Under this framework, we show that the popular reconstruction loss of autoencoder corresponds to an upper bound of the negative marginal log-likelihoods of unlabeled instances, where marginal distributions are given by proper kernel density estimations. This provides a way to interpret the empirical success of autoencoders in domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. We instantiate our framework using neural networks, and build a concrete model,  \\emph{DAuto}. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DAuto on text, image and speech datasets, showing that it outperforms related competitors when domain adaptation is possible.\n",

Truncated BPTT keeps the computational benefits of \\emph{Backpropagation Through Time} (BPTT \\cite{werbos:bptt}) while relieving the need for a complete backtrack through the whole data sequence at every step.  However, truncation favors short-term dependencies: the gradient estimate of truncated BPTT is biased, so that it does not benefit from the convergence guarantees from stochastic gradient theory. We introduce \\emph{Anticipated Reweighted Truncated Backpropagation} (ARTBP), an algorithm that keeps the computational benefits of truncated BPTT, while providing unbiasedness. ARTBP works by using variable truncation lengths together with carefully chosen compensation factors in the backpropagation equation. We check the viability of ARTBP on two tasks. First, a simple synthetic task where careful balancing of temporal dependencies at different scales is needed: truncated BPTT displays unreliable performance, and in worst case scenarios, divergence, while ARTBP converges reliably. Second, on Penn Treebank character-level language modelling \\cite{ptb_proc}, ARTBP slightly outperforms truncated BPTT.\n",

    "abstract": "In order to develop a scalable multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) agent that is able to execute many complex tasks, this paper introduces a new RL problem where the agent is required to execute a given task graph which describes a set of subtasks and dependencies among them. Unlike existing approaches which explicitly describe what the agent should do, our problem only describes properties of subtasks and relationships between them, which requires the agent to perform a complex reasoning to find the optimal subtask to execute. To solve this problem, we propose a neural task graph solver (NTS) which encodes the task graph using a recursive neural network. To overcome the difficulty of training, we propose a novel non-parametric gradient-based policy that performs back-propagation over a differentiable form of the task graph to compute the influence of each subtask on the other subtasks. Our NTS is pre-trained to approximate the proposed gradient-based policy and fine-tuned through actor-critic method. The experimental results on a 2D visual domain show that our method to pre-train from the gradient-based policy significantly improves the performance of NTS. We also demonstrate that our agent can perform a complex reasoning to find the optimal way of executing the task graph and generalize well to unseen task graphs. In addition, we compare our agent with a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) method showing that our method is much more efficient than MCTS, and the performance of our agent can be further improved by combining with MCTS.

    "abstract": "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is one of the most widely used recurrent structures in sequence modeling. Its goal is to use gates to control the information flow (e.g., whether to skip some information/transformation or not) in the recurrent computations, although its practical implementation based on soft gates only partially achieves this goal and is easy to overfit. In this paper, we propose a new way for LSTM training, which pushes the values of the gates towards 0 or 1. By doing so, we can (1) better control the information flow: the gates are mostly open or closed, instead of in a middle state; and (2) avoid overfitting to certain extent: the gates operate at their flat regions, which is shown to correspond to better generalization ability. However, learning towards discrete values of the gates is generally difficult. To tackle this challenge, we leverage the recently developed Gumbel-Softmax trick from the field of variational methods, and make the model trainable with standard backpropagation. Experimental results on language modeling and machine translation show that (1) the values of the gates generated by our method are more reasonable and intuitively interpretable, and (2) our proposed method generalizes better and achieves better accuracy on test sets in all tasks. Moreover, the learnt models are not sensitive to low-precision approximation and low-rank approximation of the gate parameters due to the flat loss surface.",

In this paper, we are interested to design neural networks for graphs with variable length in order to solve learning problems such as vertex classification, graph classification, graph regression, and graph generative tasks. Most existing works have focused on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn meaningful representations of graphs, and more recently new convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have been introduced. In this work, we want to compare rigorously these two fundamental families of architectures to solve graph learning tasks. We review existing graph RNN and ConvNet architectures, and propose natural extension of LSTM and ConvNet to graphs with arbitrary size. Then, we design a set of analytically controlled experiments on two basic graph problems, i.e. subgraph matching and graph clustering, to test the different architectures.  Numerical results show that the proposed graph ConvNets are 3-17% more accurate and 1.5-4x faster than graph RNNs. Graph ConvNets are also 36% more accurate than variational (non-learning) techniques. Finally, the most effective graph ConvNet architecture uses gated edges and residuality. Residuality plays an essential role to learn multi-layer architectures as they provide a 10% gain of performance.",

To achieve this so-called grounded language learning, models must overcome certain well-studied learning challenges that are also fundamental to infants learning their first words. While it is notable that models with no meaningful prior knowledge overcome these learning obstacles, AI researchers and practitioners currently lack a clear understanding of exactly how they do so. Here we address this question as a way of achieving a clearer general understanding of grounded language learning, both to inform future research and to improve confidence in model predictions. For maximum control and generality, we focus on a simple neural network-based language learning agent trained via policy-gradient methods to interpret synthetic linguistic instructions in a simulated 3D world. We apply experimental paradigms from developmental psychology to this agent, exploring the conditions under which established human biases and learning effects emerge. We further propose a novel way to visualise and analyse semantic representation in grounded language learning agents that yields a plausible computational account of the observed effects.",

Many reinforcement learning problems, however, involve high-dimensional discrete action spaces as well as high-dimensional state spaces. In this paper, we develop a novel policy gradient methodology for the case of large multidimensional discrete action spaces. We propose two approaches for creating parameterized policies: LSTM parameterization and a Modified MDP (MMDP) giving rise to Feed-Forward Network (FFN) parameterization. Both of these approaches provide expressive models to which backpropagation can be applied for training. We then consider entropy bonus, which is typically added to the reward function to enhance exploration. In the case of high-dimensional action spaces, calculating the entropy and the gradient of the entropy requires enumerating all the actions in the action space and running forward and backpropagation for each action, which may be computationally infeasible. We develop several novel unbiased estimators for the entropy bonus and its gradient. Finally, we test our algorithms on two environments: a multi-hunter multi-rabbit grid game and a multi-agent multi-arm bandit problem.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been generally acknowledged as one of the driving forces for the advancement of computer vision. Despite their promising performances on many tasks, CNNs still face major obstacles on the road to achieving ideal machine intelligence. One is that CNNs are complex and hard to interpret. Another is that standard CNNs require large amounts of annotated data, which is sometimes very hard to obtain, and it is desirable to be able to learn them from few examples. In this work, we address these limitations of CNNs by developing novel, simple, and interpretable models for few-shot learn- ing. Our models are based on the idea of encoding objects in terms of visual concepts, which are interpretable visual cues represented by the feature vectors within CNNs. We first adapt the learning of visual concepts to the few-shot setting, and then uncover two key properties of feature encoding using visual concepts, which we call category sensitivity and spatial pattern. Motivated by these properties, we present two intuitive models for the problem of few-shot learning. Experiments show that our models achieve competitive performances, while being much more flexible and interpretable than alternative state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods. We conclude that using visual concepts helps expose the natural capability of CNNs for few-shot learning.",

We demonstrate this methods effectiveness by designing an optimized heat sink and both 2D and 3D airfoils that maximize the lift drag ratio under steady state flow conditions. We highlight that our method has two distinct benefits over other automated design approaches. First, evaluating the neural networks prediction of fitness can be orders of magnitude faster then simulating the system of interest.

We propose a novel hyperparameter tuning algorithm for this setting that exploits both parallelism and aggressive early-stopping techniques, building on the insights of the Hyperband algorithm.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models require extensive architecture design exploration and hyperparameter optimization to perform well on a given task. The exploration of the model design space is often made by a human expert, and optimized using a combination of grid search and search heuristics over a large space of possible choices. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a Reinforcement Learning approach that has been proposed to automate architecture design. NAS has been successfully applied to generate Neural Networks that rival the best human-designed architectures. However, NAS requires sampling, constructing, and training hundreds to thousands of models to achieve well-performing architectures. This procedure needs to be executed from scratch for each new task. The application of NAS to a wide set of tasks currently lacks a way to transfer generalizable knowledge across tasks.\nIn this paper, we present the Multitask Neural Model Search (MNMS) controller. Our goal is to learn a generalizable framework that can condition model construction on successful model searches for previously seen tasks, thus significantly speeding up the search for new tasks. We demonstrate that MNMS can conduct an automated architecture search for multiple tasks simultaneously while still learning well-performing, specialized models for each task. We then show that pre-trained MNMS controllers can transfer learning to new tasks. By leveraging knowledge from previous searches, we find that pre-trained MNMS models start from a better location in the search space and reduce search time on unseen tasks, while still discovering models that outperform published human-designed models.",

    "abstract": "Synthesizing SQL queries from natural language is a long-standing open problem and has been attracting considerable interest recently. Toward solving the problem, the de facto approach is to employ a sequence-to-sequence-style model. Such an approach will necessarily require the SQL queries to be serialized. Since the same SQL query may have multiple equivalent serializations, training a sequence-to-sequence-style model is sensitive to the choice from one of them. This phenomenon is documented as the \"order-matters\" problem. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on reinforcement learning to reward the decoder when it generates any of the equivalent serializations. However, we observe that the improvement from reinforcement learning is limited.\n    \nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., SQLNet, to fundamentally solve this problem by avoiding the sequence-to-sequence structure when the order does not matter. In particular, we employ a sketch-based approach where the sketch contains a dependency graph, so that one prediction can be done by taking into consideration only the previous predictions that it depends on. In addition, we propose a sequence-to-set model as well as the column attention mechanism to synthesize the query based on the sketch. By combining all these novel techniques, we show that SQLNet can outperform the prior art by 9% to 13% on the WikiSQL task.",

    "abstract": "The recent success of deep neural networks stems from their ability to generalize well on real data; however, Zhang et al. have observed that neural networks can easily overfit random labels. This observation demonstrates that with the existing theory, we cannot adequately explain why gradient methods can find generalizable solutions for neural networks. In this work, we use a Fourier-based approach to study the generalization properties of gradient-based methods over 2-layer neural networks with sinusoidal activation functions. We prove that if the underlying distribution of data has nice spectral properties such as bandlimitedness, then the gradient descent method will converge to generalizable local minima. We also establish a Fourier-based generalization bound for bandlimited spaces, which generalizes to other activation functions. Our generalization bound motivates a grouped version of path norms for measuring the complexity of 2-layer neural networks with ReLU activation functions. We demonstrate numerically that regularization of this group path norm results in neural network solutions that can fit true labels without losing test accuracy while not overfitting random labels.",

While GANs have demonstrated promising performance on multiple vision tasks, their learning dynamics are not yet well understood, neither in theory nor in practice. In particular, the work in this domain has been focused so far only on understanding the properties of the stationary solutions that this dynamics might converge to, and of the behavior of that dynamics in this solutions\u2019 immediate neighborhood.\n\nTo address this issue, in this work we take a first step towards a principled study of the GAN dynamics itself. To this end, we propose a model that, on one hand, exhibits several of the common problematic convergence behaviors (e.g., vanishing gradient, mode collapse, diverging or oscillatory behavior), but on the other hand, is sufficiently simple to enable rigorous convergence analysis.\n\nThis methodology enables us to exhibit an interesting phenomena: a GAN with an optimal discriminator provably converges, while guiding the GAN training using only a first order approximation of the discriminator leads to unstable GAN dynamics and mode collapse. This suggests that such usage of the first order approximation of the discriminator, which is a de-facto standard in all the existing GAN dynamics, might be one of the factors that makes GAN training so challenging in practice. Additionally, our convergence result constitutes the first rigorous analysis of a dynamics of a concrete parametric GAN.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become the state of the art approach in many machine learning problems such as classification. It has recently been shown that deep learning is highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Taking the camera systems of self-driving cars as an example, small adversarial perturbations can cause the system to  make errors in important tasks, such as classifying traffic signs or detecting pedestrians. Hence, in order to use deep learning without safety concerns a proper defense strategy is required. We propose to use ensemble methods as a defense strategy against adversarial perturbations. We find that an attack leading one model to misclassify does not imply the same for other networks performing the same task. This makes ensemble methods an attractive defense strategy against adversarial attacks. We empirically show for the MNIST and the CIFAR-10 data sets that ensemble methods not only improve the accuracy of neural networks on test data but also increase their robustness against adversarial perturbations.",

This poses the question of how to compactly represent all the information that the population codes carry across all these dimensions. Here, we developed an analytical method to factorize a large number of retinal ganglion cells' spike trains into a robust low-dimensional representation that captures efficiently both their spatial and temporal information. In particular, we extended previously used single-trial space-by-time tensor decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization to efficiently discount pre-stimulus baseline activity. On data recorded from retinal ganglion cells with strong pre-stimulus baseline, we showed that in situations were the stimulus elicits a strong change in firing rate, our extensions yield a boost in stimulus decoding performance. Our results thus suggest that taking into account the baseline can be important for finding a compact information-rich representation of neural activity.",

    "abstract": "Planning problems are among the most important and well-studied problems in artificial intelligence. They are most typically solved by tree search algorithms that simulate ahead into the future, evaluate future states, and back-up those evaluations to the root of a search tree. Among these algorithms, Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) is one of the most general, powerful and widely used. A typical implementation of MCTS uses cleverly designed rules, optimised to the particular characteristics of the domain. These rules control where the simulation traverses, what to evaluate in the states that are reached, and how to back-up those evaluations. In this paper we instead learn where, what and how to search. Our architecture, which we call an MCTSnet, incorporates simulation-based search inside a neural network, by expanding, evaluating and backing-up a vector embedding. The parameters of the network are trained end-to-end using gradient-based optimisation. When applied to small searches in the well-known planning problem Sokoban, the learned search algorithm significantly outperformed MCTS baselines. ",

While most methods of estimating motion are based on pixel-level constraints, we use these group properties to constrain the abstract representation of motion itself. We demonstrate that a deep neural network trained using this method captures motion in both synthetic 2D sequences and real-world sequences of vehicle motion, without requiring any labels. Networks trained to respect these constraints implicitly identify the image characteristic of motion in different sequence types. In the context of vehicle motion, this method extracts information useful for localization, tracking, and odometry.

    "abstract": "Two fundamental problems in unsupervised learning are efficient inference for latent-variable models and robust density estimation based on large amounts of unlabeled data. For efficient inference, normalizing flows have been recently developed to approximate a target distribution arbitrarily well. In practice, however, normalizing flows only consist of a finite number of deterministic transformations, and thus they possess no guarantee on the approximation accuracy. For density estimation, the generative adversarial network (GAN) has been advanced as an appealing model, due to its often excellent performance in generating samples. In this paper, we propose the concept of {\\em continuous-time flows} (CTFs), a family of diffusion-based methods that are able to asymptotically approach a target distribution. Distinct from normalizing flows and GANs, CTFs can be adopted to achieve the above two goals in one framework, with theoretical guarantees. Our framework includes distilling knowledge from a CTF for efficient inference, and learning an explicit  energy-based distribution with CTFs for density estimation. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate promising performance of the proposed CTF framework, compared to related techniques.",

Such an end-to-end learned representation finds more compact feature maps by exploiting quantization redundancies within the fixed-point activations along the channel or spatial dimensions.

    "abstract": "Modeling informal inference in natural language is very challenging. With the recent availability of large annotated data, it has become feasible to train complex models such as neural networks to perform natural language inference (NLI), which have achieved state-of-the-art performance. Although there exist relatively large annotated data, can machines learn all knowledge needed to perform NLI from the data? If not, how can NLI models benefit from external knowledge and how to build NLI models to leverage it? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions by enriching the state-of-the-art neural natural language inference models with external knowledge. We demonstrate that the proposed models with external knowledge further improve the state of the art on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Training generative adversarial networks is unstable in high-dimensions as the true data distribution tends to be concentrated in a small fraction of the ambient space. The discriminator is then quickly able to classify nearly all generated samples as fake, leaving the generator without meaningful gradients and causing it to deteriorate after a point in training. In this work, we propose training a single generator simultaneously against an array of discriminators, each of which looks at a different random low-dimensional projection of the data. Individual discriminators, now provided with restricted views of the input, are unable to reject generated samples perfectly and continue to provide meaningful gradients to the generator throughout training.  Meanwhile, the generator learns to produce samples consistent with the full data distribution to satisfy all discriminators simultaneously. We  demonstrate the practical utility of this approach experimentally, and show that it is able to produce image samples with higher quality than traditional training with a single discriminator.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent or SGD is the most popular optimization algorithm for large-scale problems. SGD estimates the gradient by uniform sampling with sample size one. There have been several other works that suggest faster epoch wise convergence by using weighted non-uniform sampling for better gradient estimates. Unfortunately, the per-iteration cost of maintaining this adaptive distribution for gradient estimation is more than calculating the full gradient. As a result, the false impression of faster convergence in iterations leads to slower convergence in time, which we call a chicken-and-egg loop. In this paper, we break this barrier by providing the first demonstration of a sampling scheme, which leads to superior gradient estimation, while keeping the sampling cost per iteration similar to that of the uniform sampling. Such an algorithm is possible due to the sampling view of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which came to light recently. As a consequence of superior and fast estimation, we reduce the running time of all existing gradient descent algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposal on both SGD and AdaGrad.",

While most methods involve a quantization step, we propose a principled Bayesian approach where we first infer a distribution over a discrete weight space from which we subsequently derive hardware-friendly low precision NNs. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic forward pass to approximate the intractable variational objective that allows us to optimize over discrete-valued weight distributions for NNs with sign activation functions. In our experiments, we show that our model achieves state of the art performance on several real world data sets.

    "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that many machine learning classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples. In attempting to explain the origin of adversarial examples, previous studies have typically focused on the fact that neural networks operate on high dimensional data, they overfit, or they are too linear. Here we show that distributions of logit differences have a universal functional form. This functional form is independent of architecture, dataset, and training protocol; nor does it change during training. This leads to adversarial error having a universal scaling, as a power-law, with respect to the size of the adversarial perturbation. We show that this universality holds for a broad range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, ImageNet, and random data), models (including state-of-the-art deep networks, linear models, adversarially trained networks, and networks trained on randomly shuffled labels), and attacks (FGSM, step l.l., PGD). Motivated by these results, we study the effects of reducing prediction entropy on adversarial robustness. Finally, we study the effect of network architectures on adversarial sensitivity. To do this, we use neural architecture search with reinforcement learning to find adversarially robust architectures on CIFAR10. Our resulting architecture is more robust to white \\emph{and} black box attacks compared to previous attempts.\n",

    "abstract": "Profiling cellular phenotypes from microscopic imaging can provide meaningful biological information resulting from various factors affecting the cells. One motivating application is drug development: morphological cell features can be captured from images, from which similarities between different drugs applied at different dosages can be quantified. The general approach is to find a function mapping the images to an embedding space of manageable dimensionality whose geometry captures relevant features of the input images. An important known issue for such methods is separating relevant biological signal from nuisance variation. For example, the embedding vectors tend to be more correlated for cells that were cultured and imaged during the same week than for cells from a different week, despite having identical drug compounds applied in both cases. In this case, the particular batch a set of experiments were conducted in constitutes the domain of the data; an ideal set of image embeddings should contain only the relevant biological information (e.g. drug effects). We develop a general framework for adjusting the image embeddings in order to `forget' domain-specific information while preserving relevant biological information. To do this, we minimize a loss function based on distances between marginal distributions (such as the Wasserstein distance) of embeddings across domains for each replicated treatment. For the dataset presented, the replicated treatment is the negative control. We find that for our transformed embeddings (1) the underlying geometric structure is not only preserved but the embeddings also carry improved biological signal (2) less domain-specific information is present.",

However, directly augmenting in the image domain may not necessarily generate training data that sufficiently explore the intra-class space for one-shot classification. Inspired by the recent vocabulary-informed learning, we propose to generate synthetic training data with the guide of the semantic word space. Essentially, we train an auto-encoder as a bridge to enable the transformation between the image feature space and the semantic space. Besides directly augmenting image features, we transform the image features to semantic space using the encoder and perform the data augmentation. The decoder then synthesizes the image features for the augmented instances from the semantic space. Experiments on three datasets show that our data augmentation method effectively improves the performance of one-shot classification. An extensive study shows that data augmented from semantic space are complementary with those from the image space, and thus boost the classification accuracy dramatically. Source code and dataset will be available. ",

We make contributions to this issue by considering a modified version of the fully connected layer we call a block diagonal inner product layer. These modified layers have weight matrices that are block diagonal, turning a single fully connected layer into a set of densely connected neuron groups. This idea is a natural extension of group, or depthwise separable, convolutional layers applied to the fully connected layers. Block diagonal inner product layers can be achieved by either initializing a purely block diagonal weight matrix or by iteratively pruning off diagonal block entries. This method condenses network storage and speeds up the run time without significant adverse effect on the testing accuracy, thus offering a new approach to improve network computation efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning in environments with large state-action spaces is challenging, as exploration can be highly inefficient. Even if the dynamics are simple, the optimal policy can be combinatorially hard to discover. In this work, we propose a hierarchical approach to structured exploration to improve the sample efficiency of on-policy exploration in large state-action spaces. The key idea is to model a stochastic policy as a hierarchical latent variable model, which can learn low-dimensional structure in the state-action space, and to define exploration by sampling from the low-dimensional latent space. This approach enables lower sample complexity, while preserving policy expressivity. In order to make learning tractable, we derive a joint learning and exploration strategy by combining hierarchical variational inference with actor-critic learning. The benefits of our learning approach are that 1) it is principled, 2) simple to implement, 3) easily scalable to settings with many actions and 4) easily composable with existing deep learning approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on learning a deep centralized multi-agent policy, as multi-agent environments naturally have an exponentially large state-action space. In this setting, the latent hierarchy implements a form of multi-agent coordination during exploration and execution (MACE). We demonstrate empirically that MACE can more efficiently learn optimal policies in challenging multi-agent games with a large number (~20) of agents, compared to conventional baselines. Moreover, we show that our hierarchical structure leads to meaningful agent coordination.",

    "abstract": "When training a deep neural network for supervised image classification, one can broadly distinguish between two types of latent features of images that will drive the classification of class Y. Following the notation of Gong et al. (2016), we can divide features broadly into the classes of (i) \u201ccore\u201d or \u201cconditionally invariant\u201d features X^ci whose distribution P(X^ci | Y) does not change substantially across domains and (ii) \u201cstyle\u201d or \u201corthogonal\u201d features X^orth whose distribution P(X^orth | Y) can change substantially across domains. These latter orthogonal features would generally include features such as position, rotation, image quality or brightness but also more complex ones like hair color or posture for images of persons. We try to guard against future adversarial domain shifts by ideally just using the \u201cconditionally invariant\u201d features for classification. In contrast to previous work, we assume that the domain itself is not observed and hence a latent variable. We can hence not directly see the distributional change of features across different domains. \n\nWe do assume, however, that we can sometimes observe a so-called identifier or ID variable. We might know, for example, that two images show the same person, with ID referring to the identity of the person. In data augmentation, we generate several images from the same original image, with ID referring to the relevant original image. The method requires only a small fraction of images to have an ID variable.\n\nWe provide a causal framework for the problem by adding the ID variable to the model of Gong et al. (2016). However, we are interested in settings where we cannot observe the domain directly and we treat domain as a latent variable. If two or more samples share the same class and identifier, (Y, ID)=(y,i), then we treat those samples as counterfactuals under different style interventions on the orthogonal or style features. Using this grouping-by-ID approach, we regularize the network to provide near constant output across samples that share the same ID by penalizing with an appropriate graph Laplacian. This is shown to substantially improve performance in settings where domains change in terms of image quality, brightness, color changes, and more complex changes such as changes in movement and posture. We show links to questions of interpretability, fairness and transfer learning.",

However, if the agent knows which properties of the environment we consider im- portant, then after learning how its actions affect those properties the agent may be able to use this knowledge to solve complex tasks without training specifi- cally for them. Towards this end, we consider a setup in which an environment is augmented with a set of user defined attributes that parameterize the features of interest. We propose a model that learns a policy for transitioning between \u201cnearby\u201d sets of attributes, and maintains a graph of possible transitions. Given a task at test time that can be expressed in terms of a target set of attributes, and a current state, our model infers the attributes of the current state and searches over paths through attribute space to get a high level plan, and then uses its low level policy to execute the plan. We show in grid-world games and 3D block stacking that our model is able to generalize to longer, more complex tasks at test time even when it only sees short, simple tasks at train time.\n",

Existing algorithms suffer from many limitations, such as unpredictable disentangling factors, bad quality of generated images from encodings, lack of identity information, etc. In this paper, we proposed a supervised algorithm called DNA-GAN trying to disentangle different attributes of images. The latent representations of images are DNA-like, in which each individual piece represents an independent factor of variation. By annihilating the recessive piece and swapping a certain piece of two latent representations, we obtain another two different representations which could be decoded into images. In order to obtain realistic images and also disentangled representations, we introduced the discriminator for adversarial training. Experiments on Multi-PIE and CelebA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the advantage of overcoming limitations existing in other methods.",

In contrast to autoencoder, which reconstructs the input data, neighbor-encoder reconstructs the input data's neighbors. The proposed neighbor-encoder can be considered as a generalization of autoencoder as the input data can be treated as the nearest neighbor of itself with zero distance. By reformulating the representation learning problem as a neighbor reconstruction problem, domain knowledge can be easily incorporated with appropriate definition of similarity or distance between objects. As such, any existing similarity search algorithms can be easily integrated into our framework. Applications of other algorithms (e.g., association rule mining) in our framework is also possible since the concept of ``neighbor\" is an abstraction which can be appropriately defined differently in different contexts. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework in various domains, including images, time series, music, etc., with various neighbor definitions. Experimental results show that neighbor-encoder outperforms autoencoder in most scenarios we considered.",

Long-term forecasting in such systems is highly challenging, since there exist long-term temporal dependencies, higher-order correlations and sensitivity to error propagation. Our proposed tensor recurrent architecture addresses these issues by learning the nonlinear dynamics directly using higher order moments and high-order state transition functions. Furthermore, we decompose the higher-order structure using the tensor-train (TT) decomposition to reduce the number of parameters while preserving the model performance. We theoretically establish the approximation properties of Tensor-Train RNNs for general sequence inputs, and such guarantees are not available for usual RNNs.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy - that is, succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as either off-policy Q-learning, or on-policy policy gradient methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.",

    "abstract": "Policy gradient reinforcement learning has been applied to two-player alternate-turn zero-sum games, e.g., in AlphaGo, self-play REINFORCE was used to improve the neural net model after supervised learning. In this paper, we emphasize that two-player zero-sum games with alternating turns, which have been previously formulated as Alternating Markov Games (AMGs), are different from standard MDP because of their two-agent nature. We exploit the difference in associated Bellman equations, which leads to different policy iteration algorithms. As policy gradient method is a kind of generalized policy iteration, we show how these differences in policy iteration are reflected in policy gradient for AMGs. We formulate an adversarial policy gradient and discuss potential possibilities for developing better policy gradient methods other than self-play REINFORCE. The core idea is to estimate the minimum rather than the mean for the \u201ccritic\u201d. Experimental results on the game of Hex show the modified Monte Carlo policy gradient methods are able to learn better pure neural net policies than the REINFORCE variants. To apply learned neural weights to multiple board sizes Hex, we describe a board-size independent neural net architecture. We show that when combined with search, using a single neural net model, the resulting program consistently beats MoHex 2.0, the state-of-the-art computer Hex player, on board sizes from 9\u00d79 to 13\u00d713.

This is because the real visual world has a few classes that are common while others are rare. Unfortunately, the performance of a convolutional neural network is typically unsatisfactory when trained using a long-tailed dataset. To alleviate this issue, we propose a method that discriminatively learns an embedding in which a simple Bayesian classifier can balance the class-priors to generalize well for rare classes. To this end, the proposed approach uses a Gaussian mixture model to factor out class-likelihoods and class-priors in a long-tailed dataset. The proposed method is simple and easy-to-implement in existing deep learning frameworks. Experiments on publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach improves the performance on classes with few training instances, while maintaining a comparable performance to the state-of-the-art on classes with abundant training examples.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms achieve high classification accuracy at the expense of significant computation cost. To address this cost, a number of quantization schemeshave been proposed - but most of these techniques focused on quantizing weights, which are relatively smaller in size compared to activations. This paper proposes a novel quantization scheme for activations during training - that enables neural networks to work well with ultra low precision weights and activations without any significant accuracy degradation.  This technique, PArameterized Clipping acTi-vation (PACT), uses an activation clipping parameter \u03b1 that is optimized duringtraining to find the right quantization scale. PACT allows quantizing activations toarbitrary bit precisions, while achieving much better accuracy relative to publishedstate-of-the-art quantization schemes. We show, for the first time, that both weights and activations can be quantized to 4-bits of precision while still achieving accuracy comparable to full precision networks across a range of popular models and datasets. We also show that exploiting these reduced-precision computational units in hardware can enable a super-linear improvement in inferencing performance dueto a significant reduction in the area of accelerator compute engines coupled with the ability to retain the quantized model and activation data in on-chip memories.",

We demonstrate that lossy episodic experience storage can enable efficient function transferability between different architectures and algorithms at a fraction of the storage cost of lossless storage. This is achieved by introducing a generative knowledge distillation strategy that does not store any full training examples. As an important extension of this idea, we show that lossy recollections stabilize deep networks much better than lossless sampling in resource constrained settings of lifelong learning while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

    "abstract": "Modern deep artificial neural networks have achieved impressive results through models with very large capacity---compared to the number of training examples---that control overfitting with the help of different forms of regularization. Regularization can be implicit, as is the case of stochastic gradient descent or parameter sharing in convolutional layers, or explicit. Most common explicit regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, reduce the effective capacity of the model and typically require the use of deeper and wider architectures to compensate for the reduced capacity. Although these techniques have been proven successful in terms of results, they seem to waste capacity. In contrast, data augmentation techniques reduce the generalization error by increasing the number of training examples and without reducing the effective capacity. In this paper we systematically analyze the effect of data augmentation on some popular architectures and conclude that data augmentation alone---without any other explicit regularization techniques---can achieve the same performance or higher as regularized models, especially when training with fewer examples.",

    "abstract": "Model pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a deep neural network's various connection matrices, thereby reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters in the model. Recent reports (Han et al., 2015; Narang et al., 2017) prune deep networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure, exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we find large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Topic modeling of text documents is one of the most important tasks in representation learning. In this work, we propose iTM-VAE, which is a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) topic model with variational auto-encoders. On one hand, as a BNP topic model, iTM-VAE potentially has infinite topics and can adapt the topic number to data automatically. On the other hand, different with the other BNP topic models, the inference of iTM-VAE is modeled by neural networks, which has rich representation capacity and can be computed in a simple feed-forward manner. Two variants of iTM-VAE are also proposed in this paper, where iTM-VAE-Prod models the generative process in products-of-experts fashion for better performance and iTM-VAE-G places a prior over the concentration parameter such that the model can adapt a suitable concentration parameter to data automatically. Experimental results on 20News and Reuters RCV1-V2 datasets show that the proposed models outperform the state-of-the-arts in terms of perplexity, topic coherence and document retrieval tasks. Moreover, the ability of adjusting the concentration parameter to data is also confirmed by experiments.",

    "abstract": "Word embedding is a useful approach to capture co-occurrence structures in a large corpus of text. In addition to the text data itself, we often have additional covariates associated with individual documents in the corpus---e.g. the demographic of the author, time and venue of publication, etc.---and we would like the embedding to naturally capture the information of the covariates. In this paper, we propose a new tensor decomposition model for word embeddings with covariates. Our model jointly learns a \\emph{base} embedding for all the words as well as a weighted diagonal transformation to model how each covariate modifies the base embedding. To obtain the specific embedding for a particular author or venue, for example, we can then simply multiply the base embedding by the transformation matrix associated with that time or venue. The main advantages of our approach is data efficiency and interpretability of the covariate transformation matrix. Our experiments demonstrate that our joint model learns substantially better embeddings conditioned on each covariate compared to the standard approach of learning a separate embedding for each covariate using only the relevant subset of data. Furthermore, our model encourages the embeddings to be ``topic-aligned'' in the sense that the dimensions have specific independent meanings. This allows our covariate-specific embeddings to be compared by topic, enabling downstream differential analysis. We empirically evaluate the benefits of our algorithm on several datasets, and demonstrate how it can be used to address many natural questions about the effects of covariates.",

With the missing blanks carefully created by teachers and candidate choices purposely designed to be confusing, CLOTH requires a deeper language understanding and a wider attention span than previous automatically generated cloze datasets. We show humans outperform dedicated designed baseline models by a significant margin, even when the model is trained on sufficiently large external data. We investigate the source of the performance gap, trace model deficiencies to some distinct properties of CLOTH, and identify the limited ability of comprehending a long-term context to be the key bottleneck.

Our model simultaneously optimises both the composition function and the parser, thus eliminating the need for externally-provided parse trees which are normally required for Tree-LSTM. It can therefore be seen as a tree-based RNN that is unsupervised with respect to the parse trees. As it is fully differentiable, our model is easily trained with an off-the-shelf gradient descent method and backpropagation. We demonstrate that it achieves better performance compared to various supervised Tree-LSTM architectures on a textual entailment task and a reverse dictionary task.

    "abstract": "While Bayesian optimization (BO) has achieved great success in optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions, especially tuning hyperparameters of neural networks, methods such as random search (Li et al., 2016) and multi-fidelity BO (e.g. Klein et al. (2017)) that exploit cheap approximations, e.g. training on a smaller training data or with fewer iterations, can outperform standard BO approaches that use only full-fidelity observations. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm, the continuous-fidelity knowledge gradient (cfKG) method, that can be used when fidelity is controlled by one or more continuous settings such as training data size and the number of training iterations. cfKG characterizes the value of the information gained by sampling a point at a given fidelity, choosing to sample at the point and fidelity with the largest value per unit cost. Furthermore, cfKG can be generalized, following Wu et al. (2017), to settings where derivatives are available in the optimization process, e.g. large-scale kernel learning, and where more than one point can be evaluated simultaneously. Numerical experiments show that cfKG outperforms state-of-art algorithms when optimizing synthetic functions, tuning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, and in large-scale kernel learning.",

However, black box predictions without rationales have limited used in practical applications, such as drug design. To this end, we learn to identify molecular substructures -- rationales -- that are associated with the target chemical property (e.g., toxicity). The rationales are learned in an unsupervised fashion, requiring no additional information beyond the end-to-end task. We formulate this problem as a reinforcement learning problem over the molecular graph, parametrized by two convolution networks corresponding to the rationale selection and prediction based on it, where the latter induces the reward function. We evaluate the approach on two benchmark toxicity datasets. We demonstrate that our model sustains high performance under the additional constraint that predictions strictly follow the rationales. Additionally, we validate the extracted rationales through comparison against those described in chemical literature and through synthetic experiments. ",

In this work, we propose a Recurrent GAN (RGAN) and Recurrent Conditional GAN (RCGAN) to produce realistic real-valued multi-dimensional time series, with an emphasis on their application to medical data. RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from \u2018serialised\u2019 MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit. We further discuss and analyse the privacy concerns that may arise when using RCGANs to generate realistic synthetic medical time series data, and demonstrate results from differentially private training of the RCGAN.",

Furthermore, a densely connected attention model is elaborately leveraged to improve information flow with more efficient parameter usage via multi-branch structure and local sparsity. We show that such a densely connected mechanism significantly reduces training time and memory usage for sequence-to-sequence learning.

Auction theory is introduced because inter-agent reward distribution is insufficient for optimization. Agents in NaaA maximize their profits (the difference between reward and cost) and, as a theoretical result, the auction mechanism is shown to have agents autonomously evaluate counterfactual returns as the values of other agents. NaaA enables representation trades in peer-to-peer environments, ultimately regarding unit in neural networks as agents.

    "abstract": "While much of the work in the design of convolutional networks over the last five years has revolved around the empirical investigation of the importance of depth, filter sizes, and number of feature channels, recent studies have shown that  branching, i.e., splitting the computation along parallel but distinct threads and then aggregating their outputs, represents a new promising dimension for significant improvements in performance. To combat the complexity of design choices in multi-branch architectures, prior work has adopted simple strategies, such as a fixed branching factor, the same input being fed to all parallel branches, and an additive combination of the outputs produced by all branches at aggregation points. \n\nIn this work we remove these predefined choices and propose an algorithm to learn the connections between branches in the network. Instead of being chosen a priori by the human designer, the multi-branch connectivity is learned simultaneously with the weights of the network by optimizing a single loss function defined with respect to the end task. We demonstrate our approach on the problem of multi-class image classification using four different datasets where it yields consistently higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art ``ResNeXt'' multi-branch network given the same learning capacity.",

While exact inference and learning of these requires linear time, it can be done approximately in sub-linear time with strong concentrations guarantees. In this work, we present LSH Softmax, a method to perform sub-linear learning and inference of the softmax layer in the deep learning setting. Our method relies on the popular Locality-Sensitive Hashing to build a well-concentrated gradient estimator, using nearest neighbors and uniform samples. We also present an inference scheme in sub-linear time for LSH Softmax using the Gumbel distribution. On language modeling, we show that Recurrent Neural Networks trained with LSH Softmax perform on-par with computing the exact softmax while requiring sub-linear computations.",

    "abstract": "Given an existing trained neural network, it is often desirable to learn new capabilities without hindering performance of those already learned. Existing approaches either learn sub-optimal solutions, require joint training, or incur a substantial increment in the number of parameters for each added task, typically as many as the original network. We propose a method called Deep Adaptation Networks (DAN) that constrains newly learned filters to be linear combinations of existing ones. DANs preserve performance on the original task, require a fraction (typically 13%) of the number of parameters compared to standard fine-tuning procedures and converge in less cycles of training to a comparable or better level of performance. When coupled with standard network quantization techniques, we further reduce the parameter cost to around 3% of the original with negligible or no loss in accuracy. The learned architecture can be controlled to switch between various learned representations, enabling a single network to solve a task from multiple different domains. We conduct extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of our method on a range of image classification tasks and explore different aspects of its behavior.",

The goal is to generalise from an initial large-scale classification task to a separate task comprising new  classes and small numbers of examples. The new approach not only leverages the feature-based representation learned by a neural network from the initial task (representational transfer), but also information about the classes (concept transfer). The concept information is encapsulated in a probabilistic model for the final layer weights of the neural network which acts as a prior for probabilistic k-shot learning. We show that even a simple probabilistic model achieves state-of-the-art on a standard k-shot learning dataset by a large margin. Moreover, it is able to accurately model uncertainty, leading to well calibrated classifiers, and is easily extensible and flexible, unlike many recent approaches to k-shot learning.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to combine imitation and reinforcement learning via the idea of reward shaping using an oracle. We study the effectiveness of the near-optimal cost-to-go oracle on the planning horizon and demonstrate that the cost-to-go oracle shortens the learner\u2019s planning horizon as function of its accuracy: a globally optimal oracle can shorten the planning horizon to one, leading to a one-step greedy Markov Decision Process which is much easier to optimize, while an oracle that is far away from the optimality requires planning over a longer horizon to achieve near-optimal performance. Hence our new insight bridges the gap and interpolates between imitation learning and reinforcement learning. Motivated by the above mentioned insights, we propose Truncated HORizon Policy Search (THOR), a method that focuses on searching for policies that maximize the total reshaped reward over a finite planning horizon when the oracle is sub-optimal. We experimentally demonstrate that a gradient-based implementation of THOR can achieve superior performance compared to RL baselines and IL baselines even when the oracle is sub-optimal.",

Unlike the codewords of channel coding, however, the representations of learning cannot be directly designed or controlled. Therefore, we develop a family of penalty regularizers where each one aims to affect one of representation's statistical properties such as sparsity, variance, or covariance. The regularizers are extended to perform class-wise regularization, and the extension is found to provide an outstanding shaping capability. A variety of statistical properties are investigated for 10 different regularization strategies including dropout and batch normalization, and several interesting findings are reported. Using the family of regularizers, performance improvements are confirmed for MNIST, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10 classification problems. But more importantly, our results suggest that understanding how to manipulate statistical properties of representations can be an important step toward understanding DNN and that the role and effect of DNN regularizers need to be reconsidered.",

Yet language generated by RNNs often shows several degenerate characteristics that are uncommon in human language; while fluent, RNN language production can be overly generic, repetitive, and even self-contradictory.  We postulate that the objective function optimized by RNN language models, which amounts to the overall perplexity of a text, is not expressive enough to capture the abstract qualities of good generation such as Grice\u2019s Maxims. In this paper, we introduce a general learning framework that can construct a decoding objective better suited for generation. Starting with a generatively trained RNN language model, our framework learns to construct a substantially stronger generator by combining several discriminatively trained models that can collectively address the limitations of RNN generation.  Human evaluation demonstrates that text generated by the resulting generator is preferred over  that  of  baselines  by  a  large  margin  and  significantly  enhances  the  overall coherence, style, and information content of the generated text.",

In this setting, can an adversary obtain the private samples if the classification model is given to the adversary? We call this reverse engineering against the classification model the Classifier-to-Generator (C2G) Attack. This situation arises when the classification model is embedded into mobile devices for offline prediction (e.g., object recognition for the automatic driving car and face recognition for mobile phone authentication).\nFor C2G attack, we introduce a novel GAN, PreImageGAN. In PreImageGAN, the generator is designed to estimate the the sample distribution conditioned by the preimage of classification model $f$, $P(X|f(X)=y)$, where $X$ is the random variable on the sample space and $y$ is the probability vector representing the target label arbitrary specified by the adversary. In experiments, we demonstrate PreImageGAN works successfully with hand-written character recognition and face recognition. In character recognition, we show that, given a recognition model of hand-written digits, PreImageGAN allows the adversary to extract alphabet letter images without knowing that the model is built for alphabet letter images. In face recognition, we show that, when an adversary obtains a face recognition model for a set of individuals, PreImageGAN allows the adversary to extract face images of specific individuals contained in the set, even when the adversary has no knowledge of the face of the individuals.",

However, it is also possible to regularize in the space of functions. Here, we propose to measure networks in an $L^2$ Hilbert space, and test a learning rule that regularizes the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space each update.  This approach is inspired by the slow movement of gradient descent through parameter space as well as by the natural gradient, which can be derived from a regularization term upon functional change. The resulting learning rule, which we call Hilbert-constrained gradient descent (HCGD), is thus closely related to the natural gradient but regularizes a different and more calculable metric over the space of functions. Experiments show that the HCGD is efficient and leads to considerably better generalization. ",

We show that the proposed discriminator can be used to improve the performance on semantic segmentation by coupling the adversarial loss with the standard cross entropy loss on the segmentation network. In addition, the fully convolutional discriminator enables the semi-supervised learning through discovering the trustworthy regions in prediction results of unlabeled images, providing additional supervisory signals. In contrast to existing methods that utilize weakly-labeled images, our method leverages unlabeled images without any annotation to enhance the segmentation model.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a generic and simple strategy for utilizing stochastic gradient information in optimization. The technique essentially contains two consecutive steps in each iteration: 1) computing and normalizing each block (layer) of the mini-batch stochastic gradient; 2) selecting appropriate step size to update the decision variable (parameter) towards the negative of the block-normalized gradient. We conduct extensive empirical studies on various non-convex neural network optimization problems, including multilayer perceptron, convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The results indicate the block-normalized gradient can help accelerate the training of neural networks.  In particular,\nwe observe that the normalized gradient methods having constant step size with occasionally decay, such as SGD with momentum, have better performance in the deep convolution neural networks, while those with adaptive step sizes, such as Adam, perform better in recurrent neural networks. Besides, we also observe this line of methods can lead to solutions with better generalization properties, which is confirmed by the performance improvement over strong baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Prepositions are among the most frequent words. Good prepositional representation  is of great syntactic and semantic interest  in computational linguistics. Existing methods on preposition representation either treat prepositions as content words (e.g., word2vec and GloVe) or depend heavily on external linguistic resources including syntactic parsing, training task and dataset-specific representations. In this paper we use word-triple counts (one of the words is a preposition) to  capture the preposition's interaction with its head and children. Prepositional  embeddings are derived via tensor decompositions on a large unlabeled corpus.  We reveal a new geometry involving Hadamard products and empirically demonstrate its utility in paraphrasing of phrasal verbs. Furthermore, our prepositional  embeddings are used as simple features to two challenging downstream tasks: preposition selection and prepositional attachment disambiguation. We achieve comparable to or better results than state of the art on  multiple standardized datasets.  ",

    "abstract": "Data structured in form of overlapping or non-overlapping sets is found in a variety of domains, sometimes explicitly but often subtly. For example, teams, which are of prime importance in social science studies are \\enquote{sets of individuals}; \\enquote{item sets} in pattern mining are sets; and for various types of analysis in language studies a sentence can be considered as a \\enquote{set or bag of words}. Although building models and inference algorithms for structured data has been an important task in the fields of machine learning and statistics, research on \\enquote{set-like} data still remains less explored. Relationships between pairs of elements can be modeled as edges in a graph. However, modeling relationships that involve all members of a set, a hyperedge is a more natural representation for the set. In this work, we focus on the problem of embedding hyperedges in a hypergraph (a network of overlapping sets) to a low dimensional vector space. We propose a probabilistic deep-learning based method as well as a tensor-based algebraic model, both of which capture the hypergraph structure in a principled manner without loosing set-level information. Our central focus is to highlight the connection between hypergraphs (topology), tensors (algebra) and probabilistic models. We present a number of interesting baselines, some of which adapt existing node-level embedding models to the hyperedge-level, as well as sequence based language techniques which are adapted for set structured hypergraph topology. The performance is evaluated with a network of social groups and a network of word phrases. Our experiments show that accuracy wise our methods perform similar to those of baselines which are not designed for hypergraphs. Moreover, our tensor based method is quiet efficient as compared to deep-learning based auto-encoder method. We therefore, argue that we have proposed more general methods which are suited for hypergraphs (and therefore also for graphs) while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. ",

Existing approaches however primarily focus on simple link structure between a finite set of entities, ignoring the variety of data types that are often used in relational databases, such as text, images, and numerical values. In our approach, we propose a multimodal embedding using different neural encoders for this variety of data, and combine with existing models to learn embeddings of the entities. We extend existing datasets to create two novel benchmarks, YAGO-10-plus and MovieLens-100k-plus, that contain additional relations such as textual descriptions and images of the original entities. We demonstrate that our model utilizes the additional information effectively to provide further gains in accuracy.

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental tasks in understanding genomics is the problem of predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs). With more than hundreds of Transcription Factors (TFs) as labels, genomic-sequence based TFBS prediction is a challenging multi-label classification task. There are two major biological mechanisms for TF binding: (1) sequence-specific binding patterns on genomes known as \u201cmotifs\u201d and (2) interactions among TFs known as co-binding effects. In this paper, we propose a novel deep architecture, the Prototype Matching Network (PMN) to mimic the TF binding mechanisms. Our PMN model automatically extracts prototypes (\u201cmotif\u201d-like features) for each TF through a novel prototype-matching loss. Borrowing ideas from few-shot matching models, we use the notion of support set of prototypes and an LSTM to learn how TFs interact and bind to genomic sequences. On a reference TFBS dataset with 2.1 million genomic sequences, PMN significantly outperforms baselines and validates our design choices empirically. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning architecture that introduces prototype learning and considers TF-TF interactions for large scale TFBS prediction. Not only is the proposed architecture accurate, but it also models the underlying biology.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning and in particular deep learning approaches have outperformed many traditional techniques in accomplishing complex tasks such as\nimage classfication, natural language processing or speech recognition. Most of the state-of-the art deep networks have complex architecture and use a vast number of parameters to reach this superior performance. Though these networks use a large number of learnable parameters, those parameters present significant redundancy. Therefore, it is possible to compress the network without much affecting its accuracy by eliminating those redundant and unimportant parameters.\nIn this work, we propose a three stage compression pipeline, which consists of pruning, weight sharing and quantization to compress deep neural networks.\nOur novel pruning technique combines magnitude based ones with dense sparse dense ideas and iteratively finds for each layer its achievable sparsity instead of selecting a single threshold for the whole network.\nUnlike previous works, where compression is only applied on networks performing classification, we evaluate and perform compression on networks for classification as well as semantic segmentation, which is greatly useful for understanding scenes in autonomous driving.\nWe tested our method on LeNet-5 and FCNs, performing classification and semantic segmentation, respectively. With LeNet-5 on MNIST, pruning reduces the number of parameters by 15.3 times and storage requirement from 1.7 MB to 0.006 MB with accuracy loss of 0.03%. With FCN8 on Cityscapes, we decrease the number of parameters by 8 times and reduce the storage requirement from 537.47 MB to 18.23 MB with class-wise intersection-over-union (IoU) loss of 4.93% on the validation data.",

We show that by maximizing the entropy of predictions about the body---touch sensors, proprioception and vestibular information---we are able to learn dynamic models of the body that can be used for control. In spite of being trained with only internally available signals, these dynamic body models come to represent external objects through the necessity of predicting their effects on the agent's own body. Our dynamics model is able to successfully predict\ndistributions over 132 sensor readings over 100 steps into the future. We demonstrate that even when the body is no longer in contact with an object, the latent variables of the dynamics model continue to represent its shape. That is, the model learns holistic persistent representations of objects in the world, even though the only training signals are body signals.\nWe also collect data from a real robotic hand and show that the same models can be used to answer questions about properties of objects in the real world.",

A few labeled raw packet streams extracted from fault archive can hardly be sufficient to deduce the intricate logic of underlying protocols. In this paper, we supplement these limited samples with two inexhaustible data sources: the unlabeled records probed from a system in service, and the labeled data simulated in an emulation environment. To transfer their inherent knowledge to the target domain, we construct a directed information flow graph, whose nodes are neural network components consisting of two generators, three discriminators and one classifier, and whose every forward path represents a pair of adversarial optimization goals, in accord with the semi-supervised and transfer learning demands. The multi-headed network can be trained in an alternative approach, at each iteration of which we select one target to update the weights along the path upstream, and refresh the residual layer-wisely to all outputs downstream. The actual results show that it can achieve comparable accuracy on classifying Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) streams without deliberate expert features. The solution has relieved operation engineers from massive works of understanding and maintaining rules, and provided a quick solution independent of specific protocols.",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is a widely used technique in many machine learning tasks, such as image classification, to virtually enlarge the training dataset size and avoid overfitting. Traditional data augmentation techniques for image classification tasks create new samples from the original training data by, for example, flipping, distorting, adding a small amount of noise to, or cropping a patch from an original image. In this paper, we introduce a simple but surprisingly effective data augmentation technique for image classification tasks. With our technique, named SamplePairing, we synthesize a new sample from one image by overlaying another image randomly chosen from the training data (i.e., taking an average of two images for each pixel). By using two images randomly selected from the training set, we can generate N^2 new samples from N training samples. This simple data augmentation technique significantly improved classification accuracy for all the tested datasets; for example, the top-1 error rate was reduced from 33.5% to 29.0% for the ILSVRC 2012 dataset with GoogLeNet and from 8.22% to 6.93% in the CIFAR-10 dataset. We also show that our SamplePairing technique largely improved accuracy when the number of samples in the training set was very small. Therefore, our technique is more valuable for tasks with a limited amount of training data, such as medical imaging tasks.\n",

Cloud-based training schemes provide beneficial services but suffer from potential privacy risks due to excessive user data collection. To enable cloud-based DNN training while protecting the data privacy simultaneously, we propose to leverage the intermediate representations of the data, which is achieved by splitting the DNNs and deploying them separately onto local platforms and the cloud. The local neural network (NN) is used to generate the feature representations. To avoid local training and protect data privacy, the local NN is derived from pre-trained NNs. The cloud NN is then trained based on the extracted intermediate representations for the target learning task. We validate the idea of DNN splitting by characterizing the dependency of privacy loss and classification accuracy on the local NN topology for a convolutional NN (CNN) based image classification task. Based on the characterization, we further propose PrivyNet to determine the local NN topology, which optimizes the accuracy of the target learning task under the constraints on privacy loss, local computation, and storage.

    "abstract": "The ability to deploy neural networks in real-world, safety-critical systems is severely limited by the presence of adversarial examples: slightly perturbed inputs that are misclassified by the network. In recent years, several techniques have been proposed for training networks that are robust to such examples; and each time stronger attacks have been devised, demonstrating the shortcomings of existing defenses. This highlights a key difficulty in designing an effective defense: the inability to assess a network's robustness against future attacks. We propose to address this difficulty through formal verification techniques. We construct ground truths: adversarial examples with a provably-minimal distance from a given input point. We demonstrate how ground truths can serve to assess the effectiveness of attack techniques, by comparing the adversarial examples produced by those attacks to the ground truths; and also of defense techniques, by computing the distance to the ground truths before and after the defense is applied, and measuring the improvement. We use this technique to assess recently suggested attack and defense techniques.\n",

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), when trained on large datasets with diverse modes, are known to produce conflated images which do not distinctly belong to any of the modes. We hypothesize that this problem occurs due to the interaction between two facts: (1) For datasets with large variety, it is likely that the modes lie on separate manifolds. (2) The generator (G) is formulated as a continuous function, and the input noise is derived from a connected set, due to which G's output is a connected set. If G covers all modes, then there must be some portion of G's output which connects them. This corresponds to undesirable, conflated images. We develop theoretical arguments to support these intuitions. We propose a novel method to break the second assumption via learnable discontinuities in the latent noise space. Equivalently, it can be viewed as training several generators, thus creating discontinuities in the G function. We also augment the GAN formulation with a classifier C that predicts which noise partition/generator produced the output images, encouraging diversity between each partition/generator. We experiment on MNIST, celebA, STL-10, and a difficult dataset with clearly distinct modes, and show that the noise partitions correspond to different modes of the data distribution, and produce images of superior quality.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have shown promising performance in computer vision. In medical imaging, encouraging results have been achieved with deep learning for applications such as segmentation, lesion detection and classification. Nearly all of the deep learning based image analysis methods work on reconstructed images, which are obtained from original acquisitions via solving inverse problems (reconstruction). The reconstruction algorithms are designed for human observers, but not necessarily optimized for DNNs which can often observe features that are incomprehensible for human eyes. Hence, it is desirable to train the DNNs directly from the original data which lie in a different domain with the images. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end DNN for abnormality detection in medical imaging. To align the acquisition with the annotations made by radiologists in the image domain, a DNN was built as the unrolled version of iterative reconstruction algorithms to map the acquisitions to images, and followed by a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect the abnormality in the reconstructed images. The two networks were trained jointly in order to optimize the entire DNN for the detection task from the original acquisitions. The DNN was implemented for lung nodule detection in low-dose chest computed tomography (CT), where a numerical simulation was done to generate acquisitions from 1,018 chest CT images with radiologists' annotations. The proposed end-to-end DNN demonstrated better sensitivity and accuracy for the task compared to a two-step approach, in which the reconstruction and detection DNNs were trained separately. A significant reduction of false positive rate on suspicious lesions were observed, which is crucial for the known over-diagnosis in low-dose lung CT imaging. The images reconstructed by the proposed end-to-end network also presented enhanced details in the region of interest. ",

    "abstract": "The concepts of unitary evolution matrices and associative memory have boosted the field of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to state-of-the-art performance in a variety of sequential tasks.  However, RNN still has a limited capacity to manipulate long-term memory.  To bypass this weakness the most successful applications of RNN use external techniques such as attention mechanisms. In this paper we propose a novel RNN model that unifies the state-of-the-art approaches: Rotational Unit of Memory (RUM). The core of RUM is its rotational operation, which is,  naturally,  a unitary matrix, providing architectures with the power to learn long-term dependencies by overcoming the vanishing and exploding gradients problem.  Moreover,  the rotational unit also serves as associative memory. We evaluate our model on synthetic memorization, question answering and language modeling tasks.   RUM learns the Copying Memory task completely and improves the state-of-the-art result in the Recall task.  RUM\u2019s performance in the bAbI Question Answering task is comparable to that of models with attention mechanism. We also improve the state-of-the-art result to 1.189 bits-per-character (BPC) loss in the Character Level Penn Treebank (PTB) task, which is to signify the applications of RUM to real-world sequential data. The universality of our construction, at the core of RNN, establishes RUM as a promising approach to language modeling, speech recognition and machine translation.",

In particular, we contrast the results from various well-known techniques for training GANs when the discriminator is near-optimal and updated multiple times per update to the generator. As an alternative, we propose an additional method to train GANs by explicitly modeling the discriminator's output as a bi-modal Gaussian distribution over the real/fake indicator variables. In order to do this, we train the Gaussian classifier to match the target bi-modal distribution implicitly through meta-adversarial training.

However, the convolution operation is not applicable when the input data is supported on an irregular graph such as with social networks, citation networks, or knowledge graphs. This paper proposes the topology adaptive graph convolutional network (TAGCN), a novel graph convolutional network that generalizes CNN architectures to graph-structured data and provides a systematic way to design a set of fixed-size learnable filters to perform convolutions on graphs. The topologies of these filters are adaptive to the topology of the graph when they scan the graph to perform convolution, replacing the square filter for the grid-structured data in traditional CNNs. The outputs are the weighted sum of these filters\u2019 outputs, extraction of both vertex features and strength of correlation between vertices. It\ncan be used with both directed and undirected graphs. The proposed TAGCN not only inherits the properties of convolutions in CNN for grid-structured data, but it is also consistent with convolution as defined in graph signal processing. Further, as no approximation to the convolution is needed, TAGCN exhibits better performance than existing graph-convolution-approximation methods on a number\nof data sets. As only the polynomials of degree two of the adjacency matrix are used, TAGCN is also computationally simpler than other recent methods.",

We propose a simple procedure for assessing generative adversarial network performance based on a principled consideration of what the actual goal of generalisation is. Our approach involves using a test set to estimate the Wasserstein distance between the generative distribution produced by our procedure, and the underlying data distribution. We use this procedure to assess the performance of several modern generative adversarial network architectures. We find that this procedure is sensitive to the choice of ground metric on the underlying data space, and suggest a choice of ground metric that substantially improves performance.  We finally suggest that attending to the ground metric used in Wasserstein generative adversarial network training may be fruitful, and outline a concrete pathway towards doing so.",

    "abstract": "The Wasserstein probability metric has received much attention from the machine learning community. Unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which strictly measures change in probability, the Wasserstein metric reflects the underlying geometry between outcomes. The value of being sensitive to this geometry has been demonstrated, among others, in ordinal regression and generative modelling, and most recently in reinforcement learning. In this paper we describe three natural properties of probability divergences that we believe reflect requirements from machine learning: sum invariance, scale sensitivity, and unbiased sample gradients. The Wasserstein metric possesses the first two properties but, unlike the Kullback-Leibler divergence, does not possess the third. We provide empirical evidence suggesting this is a serious issue in practice. Leveraging insights from probabilistic forecasting we propose an alternative to the Wasserstein metric, the Cram\u00e9r distance. We show that the Cram\u00e9r distance possesses all three desired properties, combining the best of the Wasserstein and Kullback-Leibler divergences. We give empirical results on a number of domains comparing these three divergences. To illustrate the practical relevance of the Cram\u00e9r distance we design a new algorithm, the Cram\u00e9r Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and show that it has a number of desirable properties over the related Wasserstein GAN.\n",

Moreover, it is successfully able to combine these representations to generate data not seen at training time. The model enjoys an exponential increase in representational ability for a linear increase in context count.

To fulfill these three requirements, a model must be able to output a reject option (i.e. say \"``I Don't Know\") when it is not qualified to make a prediction. In this work, we propose learning to defer, a method by which a model can defer judgment to a downstream decision-maker such as a human user. We show that learning to defer generalizes the rejection learning framework in two ways: by considering the effect of other agents in the decision-making process, and by allowing for optimization of complex objectives. We propose a learning algorithm which accounts for potential biases held by decision-makerslater in a pipeline. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that learning\nto defer can make a model not only more accurate but also less biased.

    "abstract": "Search engine users nowadays heavily depend on query completion and correction to shape their queries.  Typically, the completion is done by database lookup which does not understand the context and cannot generalize to prefixes not in the database. In the paper, we propose to use unsupervised deep language models to complete and correct the queries given an arbitrary prefix.  We show how to address two main challenges that renders this method practical for large-scale deployment: 1) we propose a method for integrating error correction into the language model completion via a edit-distance potential and a variant of beam search that can exploit these potential functions; and 2) we show how to efficiently perform CPU-based computation to complete the queries, with error correction, in real time (generating top 10 completions within 16 ms). Experiments show that the method substantially increases hit rate over standard approaches, and is capable of handling tail queries.\n",

    "abstract": "Neural embeddings have been used with great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where they provide compact representations that encapsulate word similarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic tasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of research into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is graph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that encapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge prediction and vertex labelling. For both NLP and graph-based tasks, embeddings in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces have been learned.\nHowever, recent work has shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks is not the flat Euclidean space, but a negatively curved hyperbolic space. We present a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space. We provide experimental evidence that hyperbolic embeddings significantly outperform Euclidean embeddings on vertex classification tasks for several real-world public datasets. ",

    "abstract": "There have been multiple attempts with variational auto-encoders (VAE) to learn powerful global representations of complex data using a combination of latent stochastic variables and an autoregressive model over the dimensions of the data. However, for the most challenging natural image tasks the purely autoregressive model with stochastic variables still outperform the combined stochastic autoregressive models. In this paper, we present simple additions to the VAE framework that generalize to natural images by embedding spatial information in the stochastic layers. We significantly improve the state-of-the-art results on MNIST, OMNIGLOT, CIFAR10 and ImageNet when the feature map parameterization of the stochastic variables are combined with the autoregressive PixelCNN approach. Interestingly, we also observe close to state-of-the-art results without the autoregressive part. This opens the possibility for high quality image generation with only one forward-pass.\n",

    "abstract": "In order for machine learning to be deployed and trusted in many applications, it is crucial to be able to reliably explain why the machine learning algorithm makes certain predictions. For example, if an algorithm classifies a given pathology image to be a malignant tumor, then the doctor may need to know which parts of the image led the algorithm to this classification. How to interpret black-box predictors is thus an important and active area of research.  A fundamental question is: how much can we trust the interpretation itself? In this paper, we show that interpretation of deep learning predictions is extremely fragile in the following sense:  two perceptively indistinguishable inputs with the same predicted label can be assigned very different}interpretations. We systematically characterize the fragility of the interpretations generated by several widely-used feature-importance interpretation methods (saliency maps, integrated gradient, and DeepLIFT) on ImageNet and CIFAR-10. Our experiments show that even small random perturbation can change the feature importance and new systematic perturbations can lead to dramatically different interpretations without changing the label. We extend these results to show that interpretations based on exemplars (e.g. influence functions) are similarly fragile. Our analysis of the geometry of the Hessian matrix gives insight on why fragility could be a fundamental challenge to the current interpretation approaches.",

    "abstract": "Classifiers such as deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable against adversarial perturbations on problems with high-dimensional input space. While adversarial training improves the robustness of classifiers against such adversarial perturbations, it leaves classifiers sensitive to them on a non-negligible fraction of the inputs. We argue that there are two different kinds of adversarial perturbations: shared perturbations which fool a classifier on many inputs and singular perturbations which only fool the classifier on a small fraction of the data. We find that adversarial training increases the robustness of classifiers against shared perturbations. Moreover, it is particularly effective in removing universal perturbations, which can be seen as an extreme form of shared perturbations. Unfortunately, adversarial training does not consistently increase the robustness against singular perturbations on unseen inputs. However, we find that adversarial training decreases robustness of the remaining perturbations against image transformations such as changes to contrast and brightness or  Gaussian blurring. It thus makes successful attacks on the classifier in the physical world less likely. Finally, we show that even singular perturbations can be easily detected and must thus exhibit generalizable patterns even though the perturbations are specific for certain inputs. ",

However, the structure of standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) is simply a stack of fully connected layers, regardless of the feature correlations in data. In addition, the number of layers and the number of neurons are manually tuned on validation data, which is time-consuming and may lead to suboptimal networks. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised structure learning method for learning parsimonious deep FNNs. Our method determines the number of layers, the number of neurons at each layer, and the sparse connectivity between adjacent layers automatically from data. The resulting models are called Backbone-Skippath Neural Networks (BSNNs). Experiments on 17 tasks show that, in comparison with FNNs,  BSNNs can achieve better or comparable classification performance with much fewer parameters. The interpretability of BSNNs is also shown to be better than that of FNNs.",

Recent developments such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) use two very similar, but \\textit{reverse}, deep convolutional architectures, one to generate and one to extract information from data. Does learning the parameters of both architectures obey the same rules? We exploit the causality principle of independence of mechanisms to quantify how the weights of successive layers adapt to each other. Using the recently introduced Spectral Independence Criterion, we quantify the dependencies between the kernels of successive convolutional layers and show that those are more independent for the generative process than for information extraction, in line with results from the field of causal inference. In addition, our experiments on generation of human faces suggest that more independence between successive layers of generators results in improved performance of these architectures.\n",

Rather than directly using discretized information, input data is first projected into a high-dimensional Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), where it can be modeled as a continuous function using a series of kernel bases. We then proceed to derive a closed-form solution to the continuous convolution operation between two arbitrary functions operating in different RKHS. Within this framework, convolutional filters also take the form of continuous functions, and the training procedure involves learning the RKHS to which each of these filters is projected, alongside their weight parameters. This results in much more expressive filters, that do not require spatial discretization and benefit from properties such as adaptive support and non-stationarity. Experiments on image classification are performed, using classical datasets, with results indicating that the proposed continuous convolutional neural network is able to achieve competitive accuracy rates with far fewer parameters and a faster convergence rate.",

To understand this phenomenon, we investigate how and why training fails for strong regularization. Specifically, we examine how gradients change over time for different regularization strengths and provide an analysis why the gradients diminish so fast. We find that there exists a tolerance level of regularization strength, where the learning completely fails if the regularization strength goes beyond it. We propose a simple but novel method, Delayed Strong Regularization, in order to moderate the tolerance level.

In this regard, we revisit the idea of the master-slave architecture by incorporating both perspectives within one framework. Such a hierarchical structure naturally leverages advantages from one another. The idea of combining both perspective is intuitive and can be well motivated from many real world systems, however, out of a variety of possible realizations, we highlights three key ingredients, i.e. composed action representation, learnable communication and independent reasoning.

    "abstract": "Model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms are able to successfully solve a wide range of continuous control tasks, but typically require many on-policy samples to achieve good performance. Model-based RL algorithms are sample-efficient on the other hand, while learning accurate global models of complex dynamic environments has turned out to be tricky in practice, which leads to the unsatisfactory performance of the learned policies. In this work, we combine the sample-efficiency of model-based algorithms and the accuracy of model-free algorithms. We leverage multi-step neural network based predictive models by embedding real trajectories into imaginary rollouts of the model, and use the imaginary cumulative rewards as control variates for model-free algorithms. In this way, we achieved the strengths of both sides and derived an estimator which is not only sample-efficient, but also unbiased and of very low variance. We present our evaluation on the MuJoCo and OpenAI Gym benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Convolution neural networks typically consist of many convolutional layers followed by several fully-connected layers.  While convolutional layers map between high-order activation tensors, the fully-connected layers operate on flattened activation vectors.  Despite its success, this approach has notable drawbacks. Flattening discards the multi-dimensional structure of the activations, and the fully-connected layers require a large number of parameters. \nWe present two new techniques to address these problems.  First, we introduce tensor contraction layers which can replace the ordinary fully-connected layers in a neural network. Second, we introduce tensor regression layers, which express the output of a neural network as a low-rank multi-linear mapping from a high-order activation tensor to the softmax layer.  Both the contraction and regression weights are learned end-to-end by backpropagation. By imposing low rank on both, we use significantly fewer parameters.  Experiments on the ImageNet dataset show that applied to the popular VGG and ResNet architectures, our methods significantly reduce the number of parameters in the fully connected layers (about 65% space savings) while negligibly impacting accuracy.",

For compression, we introduce and study a trace norm regularization technique for training low rank factored versions of matrix multiplications. Compared to standard low rank training, we show that our method leads to good accuracy versus number of parameter trade-offs and can be used to speed up training of large models. For speedup, we enable faster inference on ARM processors through new open sourced kernels optimized for small batch sizes, resulting in 3x to 7x speed ups over the widely used gemmlowp library.

    "abstract": "Program translation is an important tool to migrate legacy code in one language into an ecosystem built in a different language. In this work, we are the first to consider employing deep neural networks toward tackling this problem. We observe that program translation is a modular procedure, in which a sub-tree of the source tree is translated into the corresponding target sub-tree at each step. To capture this intuition, we design a tree-to-tree neural network as an encoder-decoder architecture to translate a source tree into a target one. Meanwhile, we develop an attention mechanism for the tree-to-tree model, so that when the decoder expands one non-terminal in the target tree, the attention mechanism locates the corresponding sub-tree in the source tree to guide the expansion of the decoder. We evaluate the program translation capability of our tree-to-tree model against several state-of-the-art approaches. Compared against other neural translation models, we observe that our approach is consistently better than the baselines with a margin of up to 15 points. Further, our approach can improve the previous state-of-the-art program translation approaches by a margin of 20 points on the translation of real-world projects.",

    "abstract": "Auto-Encoders are unsupervised models that aim to learn  patterns from observed data by minimizing a reconstruction cost. The useful representations learned are often found to be sparse and distributed. On the other hand, compressed sensing and sparse coding assume a data generating process, where the observed data is generated from some true latent signal source, and try to recover the corresponding signal from measurements. Looking at auto-encoders from this signal recovery perspective enables us to have a more coherent view of these techniques. In this paper, in particular, we show that the true hidden representation can be approximately recovered if the weight matrices are highly incoherent with unit $ \\ell^{2} $ row length and the bias vectors takes the value (approximately) equal to the negative of the data mean. The recovery also becomes more and more accurate as the sparsity in hidden signals increases. Additionally, we empirically also demonstrate that auto-encoders are capable of recovering the data generating dictionary when only data samples are given.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning algorithms have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in various tasks such as image classification. This problem was addressed by employing several defense methods for detection and rejection of particular types of attacks. However, training and manipulating networks according to particular defense schemes increases computational complexity of the learning algorithms. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to improve robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to adversarial attacks by using data dependent adaptive convolution kernels. To this end, we propose a new type of HyperNetwork in order to employ statistical properties of input data and features for computation of statistical adaptive maps. Then, we filter convolution weights of CNNs with the learned statistical maps to compute dynamic kernels. Thereby, weights and kernels are collectively optimized for learning of image classification models robust to\nadversarial attacks without employment of additional target detection and rejection algorithms.\nWe empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enables CNNs to spontaneously defend against different types of attacks, e.g. attacks generated by Gaussian noise, fast gradient sign methods (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and a black-box attack (Narodytska &amp; Kasiviswanathan, 2016).",

The principle of mini-batch gradient descent is to use noisy gradient calculated on a batch to estimate the real gradient, thus balancing the computation cost per iteration and the uncertainty of noisy gradient. However, its batch size is a fixed hyper-parameter requiring manual setting before training the neural network. Yin et al. (2017) proposed a batch adaptive stochastic gradient descent (BA-SGD) that can dynamically choose a proper batch size as learning proceeds. We extend the BA-SGD to momentum algorithm and evaluate both the BA-SGD and the batch adaptive momentum (BA-Momentum) on two deep learning tasks from natural language processing to image classification. Experiments confirm that batch adaptive methods can achieve a lower loss compared with mini-batch methods after scanning the same epochs of data. Furthermore, our BA-Momentum is more robust against larger step sizes, in that it can dynamically enlarge the batch size to reduce the larger uncertainty brought by larger step sizes. We also identified an interesting phenomenon, batch size boom. The code implementing batch adaptive framework is now open source, applicable to any gradient-based optimization problems.",

In this paper, we propose new techniques that employ classification-based perspective to evaluate synthetic GAN distributions and their capability to accurately reflect the essential properties of the training data. These techniques require only minimal human supervision and can easily be scaled and adapted to evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art GANs on large, popular datasets.

These networks often have a large number of parameters and thus require much data to train. When the number of training data points is small, however, a network with high flexibility will quickly overfit the training data, resulting in a large model variance and a poor generalization performance. To address this problem, we propose a new ensemble learning method called InterBoost for small-sample image classification. In the training phase, InterBoost first randomly generates two complementary datasets to train two base networks of the same structure, separately, and then next two complementary datasets for further training the networks are generated through interaction (or information sharing) between the two base networks trained previously. This interactive training process continues iteratively until a stop criterion is met. In the testing phase, the outputs of the two networks are combined to obtain one final score for classification. Detailed analysis of the method is provided for an in-depth understanding of its mechanism.",

While adaptive algorithms, such as Adam and RMSprop, have shown better optimization performance than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in many scenarios, they often lead to worse generalization performance than SGD, when used for training deep neural networks (DNNs). In this work, we identify two problems regarding the direction and step size for updating the weight vectors of hidden units, which may degrade the generalization performance of Adam. As a solution, we propose the normalized direction-preserving Adam (ND-Adam) algorithm, which controls the update direction and step size more precisely, and thus bridges the generalization gap between Adam and SGD. Following a similar rationale, we further improve the generalization performance in classification tasks by regularizing the softmax logits. By bridging the gap between SGD and Adam, we also shed some light on why certain optimization algorithms generalize better than others.",

However the state-of-the-art models utilize fully entangled latent representations where small changes to a single neuron can effect every output pixel in relatively arbitrary ways, and different neurons have possibly arbitrary relationships with each other. This limits the ability of such models to generalize to new combinations or orientations of objects as well as their ability to connect with more structured representations such as natural language, without explicit strong supervision. In this work explore the synergistic effect of using partial natural language scene descriptions to help disentangle the latent entities visible an image. We present a novel neural network architecture called Generative Entity Networks, which jointly generates both the natural language descriptions and the images from a set of latent entities. Our model is based on the variational autoencoder framework and makes use of visual attention to identify and characterise the visual attributes of each entity. Using the Shapeworld dataset, we show that our representation both enables a better generative model of images, leading to higher quality image samples, as well as creating more semantically useful representations that improve performance over purely dicriminative models on a simple natural language yes/no question answering task.",

    "abstract": "Relational databases store a significant amount of the worlds data. However, accessing this data currently requires users to understand a query language such as SQL. We propose Seq2SQL, a deep neural network for translating natural language questions to corresponding SQL queries. Our model uses rewards from in the loop query execution over the database to learn a policy to generate the query, which contains unordered parts that are less suitable for optimization via cross entropy loss. Moreover, Seq2SQL leverages the structure of SQL to prune the space of generated queries and significantly simplify the generation problem. In addition to the model, we release WikiSQL, a dataset of 80654 hand-annotated examples of questions and SQL queries distributed across 24241 tables fromWikipedia that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable datasets. By applying policy based reinforcement learning with a query execution environment to WikiSQL, Seq2SQL outperforms a state-of-the-art semantic parser, improving execution accuracy from 35.9% to 59.4% and logical form accuracy from 23.4% to 48.3%.",

    "abstract": "This paper concerns open-world classification, where the classifier not only needs to classify test examples into seen classes that have appeared in training but also reject examples from unseen or novel classes that have not appeared in training. Specifically, this paper focuses on discovering the hidden unseen classes of the rejected examples. Clearly, without prior knowledge this is difficult. However, we do have the data from the seen training classes, which can tell us what kind of similarity/difference is expected for examples from the same class or from different classes. It is reasonable to assume that this knowledge can be transferred to the rejected examples and used to discover the hidden unseen classes in them. This paper aims to solve this problem. It first proposes a joint open classification model with a sub-model for classifying whether a pair of examples belongs to the same or different classes. This sub-model can serve as a distance function for clustering to discover the hidden classes of the rejected examples. Experimental results show that the proposed model is highly promising.\n",

    "abstract": "We propose Deep Asymmetric Multitask Feature Learning (Deep-AMTFL) which can learn deep representations shared across multiple tasks while effectively preventing negative transfer that may happen in the feature sharing process. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric autoencoder term that allows reliable predictors for the easy tasks to have high contribution to the feature learning while suppressing the influences of unreliable predictors for more difficult tasks. This allows the learning of less noisy representations, and enables unreliable predictors to exploit knowledge from the reliable predictors via the shared latent features. Such asymmetric knowledge transfer through shared features is also more scalable and efficient than inter-task asymmetric transfer. We validate our Deep-AMTFL model on multiple benchmark datasets for multitask learning and image classification, on which it significantly outperforms existing symmetric and asymmetric multitask learning models, by effectively preventing negative transfer in deep feature learning.",

We use a deep sequence to sequence model in wich the decoder uses a simple type system of SQL expressions to structure the output prediction. Based on the type, the decoder either copies an output token from the input question using an attention-based copying mechanism or generates it from a fixed vocabulary. We also introduce a value-based loss function that transforms a distribution over locations to copy from into a distribution over the set of input tokens to improve training of our model.

We approximate SGD as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and consider its Boltzmann Gibbs equilibrium distribution under the assumption of isotropic variance in loss gradients.. Through this analysis, we find that three factors \u2013 learning rate, batch size and the variance of the loss gradients \u2013 control the trade-off between the depth and width of the minima found by SGD, with wider minima favoured by a higher ratio of learning rate to batch size. In the equilibrium distribution only the ratio of learning rate to batch size appears, implying that it\u2019s invariant under a simultaneous rescaling of each by the same amount. \nWe experimentally show how learning rate and batch size affect SGD from two perspectives: the endpoint of SGD and the dynamics that lead up to it. For the endpoint, the experiments suggest the endpoint of SGD is similar under simultaneous rescaling of batch size and learning rate, and also that a higher ratio leads to flatter minima, both findings are consistent with our theoretical analysis. We note experimentally that the dynamics also seem to be similar under the same rescaling of learning rate and batch size, which we explore showing that one can exchange batch size and learning rate in a cyclical learning rate schedule. Next, we illustrate how noise affects memorization, showing that high noise levels lead to better generalization. Finally, we find experimentally that the similarity under simultaneous rescaling of learning rate and batch size breaks down if the learning rate gets too large or the batch size gets too small.",

On an unlabeled example, the model first performs inference (acting as a \"teacher\") to produce soft targets. The model then learns from these soft targets (acting as a ``\"student\"). We deviate from prior work by adding multiple auxiliary student prediction layers to the model. The input to each student layer is a sub-network of the full model that has a restricted view of the input  (e.g., only seeing one region of an image). The students can learn from the teacher (the full model) because the teacher sees more of each example. Concurrently, the students improve the quality of the representations used by the teacher as they learn to make predictions with limited data. When combined with Virtual Adversarial Training, CVT improves upon the current state-of-the-art on semi-supervised CIFAR-10 and semi-supervised SVHN. We also apply CVT to train models on five natural language processing tasks using hundreds of millions of sentences of unlabeled data. On all tasks CVT substantially outperforms supervised learning alone, resulting in models that improve upon or are competitive with the current state-of-the-art.\n",

Existing unsupervised methods either do not scale to large vocabularies or yield unacceptably poor accuracy.  This paper introduces {\\it distributional inclusion vector embedding (DIVE)}, a simple-to-implement unsupervised method of hypernym discovery via per-word non-negative vector embeddings which preserve the inclusion property of word contexts. In experimental evaluations more comprehensive than any previous literature of which we are aware---evaluating on 11 datasets using multiple existing as well as newly proposed scoring functions---we find that our method provides up to double the precision of previous unsupervised methods, and the highest average performance, using a much more compact word representation, and yielding many new state-of-the-art results. In addition, the meaning of each dimension in DIVE is interpretable, which leads to a novel approach on word sense disambiguation as another promising application of DIVE.",

Our method measures task similarities using cross-task transfer performance matrix. Although this matrix provides us critical information regarding similarities between tasks, the uncertain task-pairs, i.e., the ones with extremely asymmetric transfer scores, may collectively mislead clustering algorithms to output an inaccurate task-partition. Moreover, when the number of tasks is large, generating the full transfer performance matrix can be very time consuming. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel task clustering algorithm to estimate the similarity matrix based on the theory of matrix completion. The proposed algorithm can work on partially-observed similarity matrices based on only sampled task-pairs with reliable scores, ensuring its efficiency and robustness. Our theoretical analysis shows that under mild assumptions, the reconstructed matrix perfectly matches the underlying \u201ctrue\u201d similarity matrix with an overwhelming probability. The final task partition is computed by applying an efficient spectral clustering algorithm to the recovered matrix. Our results show that the new task clustering method can discover task clusters that benefit both multi-task learning and few-shot learning setups for sentiment classification and dialog intent classification tasks.",

We investigate the influence of GAN on conditional sequence generation with three artificial grammars and  dialogue generation. Moreover, we propose stepwise GAN (StepGAN) for conditional sequence generation, which predicts the reward at each time-step. StepGAN can be seen as the general version of SeqGAN. It estimates the expected returns predicted by Monte-Carlo Search in SeqGAN, but it has a lower computational cost than Monte-Carlo Search. Experimental results show that stepwise GAN can outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms in most tasks.",

    "abstract": "A common way to speed up training of large convolutional networks is to add  computational units. Training is then performed using data-parallel synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a mini-batch divided between computational units. With an increase in the number of nodes, the batch size grows. However,  training with a large batch  often results in lower model accuracy. We argue that the current recipe for large batch training (linear learning rate scaling with warm-up) is not general enough and training may diverge. To overcome these optimization difficulties, we propose a new training algorithm based on Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS). Using LARS, we scaled AlexNet  and ResNet-50 to a batch size of 16K.",

    "abstract": "Recent work on encoder-decoder models for sequence-to-sequence mapping has shown that integrating both temporal and spatial attentional mechanisms into neural networks increases the performance of the system substantially. We report on a new modular network architecture that applies an attentional mechanism not on temporal and spatial regions of the input, but on sensor selection for multi-sensor setups. This network called the sensor transformation attention network (STAN) is evaluated in scenarios which include the presence of natural noise or synthetic dynamic noise. We demonstrate how the attentional signal responds dynamically to changing noise levels and sensor-specific noise, leading to reduced word error rates (WERs) on both audio and visual tasks using TIDIGITS and GRID; and also on CHiME-3, a multi-microphone real-world noisy dataset. The improvement grows as more channels are corrupted as demonstrated on the CHiME-3 dataset. Moreover, the proposed STAN architecture naturally introduces a number of advantages including ease of removing sensors from existing architectures, attentional interpretability, and increased robustness to a variety of noise environments.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in adversarial Deep Learning (DL) have opened up a new and largely unexplored surface for malicious attacks jeopardizing the integrity of autonomous DL systems. We introduce a novel automated countermeasure called Parallel Checkpointing Learners (PCL) to thwart the potential adversarial attacks and significantly improve the reliability (safety) of a victim DL model. The proposed PCL methodology is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to build/train parallel checkpointing learners. We formalize the goal of preventing adversarial attacks as an optimization problem to minimize the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint checkpointing modules are trained and leveraged to validate the victim model execution in parallel. Each checkpointing learner explicitly characterizes the geometry of the input data and the corresponding high-level data abstractions within a particular DL layer. As such, the adversary is required to simultaneously deceive all the defender modules in order to succeed. We extensively evaluate the performance of the PCL methodology against the state-of-the-art attack scenarios, including Fast-Gradient-Sign (FGS), Jacobian Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), Deepfool, and Carlini&amp;WagnerL2 algorithm. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations for analyzing various data collections including MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed defense mechanism against adversarial samples.

    "abstract": "Graph kernels have been successfully applied to many graph classification problems. Typically, a kernel is first designed, and then an SVM classifier is trained based on the features defined implicitly by this kernel. This two-stage approach decouples data representation from learning, which is suboptimal. On the other hand, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have the capability to learn their own features directly from the raw data during training. Unfortunately, they cannot handle irregular data such as graphs. We address this challenge by using graph kernels to embed meaningful local neighborhoods of the graphs in a continuous vector space. A set of filters is then convolved with these patches, pooled, and the output is then passed to a feedforward network. With limited parameter tuning, our approach outperforms strong baselines on 7 out of 10 benchmark datasets, and reaches comparable performance elsewhere. Code and data are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of prior knowledge into learning is essential in achieving good performance based on small noisy samples. Such knowledge is often incorporated through the availability of related data arising from domains and tasks similar to the one of current interest. Ideally one would like to allow both the data for the current task and for previous related tasks to self-organize the learning system in such a way that commonalities and differences between the tasks are learned in a data-driven fashion. We develop a framework for learning multiple tasks simultaneously, based on sharing features that are common to all tasks, achieved through the use of a modular deep feedforward neural network consisting of shared branches, dealing with the common features of all tasks, and private branches, learning the specific unique aspects of each task. Once an appropriate weight sharing architecture has been established, learning takes place through standard algorithms for feedforward networks, e.g., stochastic gradient descent and its variations. The method deals with meta-learning (such as domain adaptation, transfer and multi-task learning) in a unified fashion, and can easily deal with data arising from different types of sources. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of learning in domain adaptation and transfer learning setups, and provide evidence for the flexible and task-oriented representations arising in the network.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks provide state-of-the-art performance for many applications of interest. Unfortunately they are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, formed by applying small but malicious perturbations to the original inputs. Moreover, the perturbations can transfer across models: adversarial examples generated for a specific model will often mislead other unseen models. Consequently  the adversary can leverage it to attack against the deployed black-box systems. \nIn this work, we demonstrate that the adversarial perturbation can be decomposed into two components: model-specific and data-dependent one, and it is the latter that mainly contributes to the transferability. Motivated by this understanding, we propose to craft adversarial examples by utilizing the noise reduced gradient (NRG) which approximates the data-dependent component. Experiments on various classification models trained on ImageNet demonstrates that the new approach enhances the transferability dramatically. We also find that low-capacity models have more powerful attack capability than high-capacity counterparts, under the condition that they have comparable test performance.  These insights give rise to a principled manner to construct adversarial examples with high success rates and could potentially provide us guidance for designing effective defense approaches against black-box attacks.

In this paper, we study how an artificial agent can autonomously acquire this intuition through interaction with the environment. We created a synthetic block stacking environment with physics simulation in which the agent can learn a policy end-to-end through trial and error. Thereby, we bypass to explicitly model physical knowledge within the policy. We are specifically interested in tasks that require the agent to reach a given goal state that may be different for every new trial. To this end, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns policies which are parametrized by a goal. We validated the model on a toy example navigating in a grid world with different target positions and in a block stacking task with different target structures of the final tower.

    "abstract": "Automated metrics such as BLEU are widely used in the machine translation literature. They have also been used recently in the dialogue community for evaluating dialogue response generation. However, previous work in dialogue response generation has shown that these metrics do not correlate strongly with human judgment in the non task-oriented dialogue setting. Task-oriented dialogue responses are expressed on narrower domains and exhibit lower diversity. It is thus reasonable to think that these automated metrics would correlate well with human judgment in the task-oriented setting where the generation task consists of translating dialogue acts into a sentence. We conduct an empirical study to confirm whether this is the case. Our findings indicate that these automated metrics have stronger correlation with human judgments in the task-oriented setting compared to what has been observed in the non task-oriented setting. We also observe that these metrics correlate even better for datasets which provide multiple ground truth reference sentences. In addition, we show that some of the currently available corpora for task-oriented language generation can be solved with simple models and advocate for more challenging datasets.",

While convolutional spiking neural networks have been demonstrated to achieve near state-of-the-art performance, only one solution has been proposed to convert gated recurrent neural networks, so far.\nRecurrent neural networks in the form of networks of gating memory cells have been central in state-of-the-art solutions in problem domains that involve sequence recognition or generation. Here, we design an analog gated LSTM cell where its neurons can be substituted for efficient stochastic spiking neurons. These adaptive spiking neurons implement an adaptive form of sigma-delta coding to convert internally computed analog activation values to spike-trains. For such neurons, we approximate the effective activation function, which resembles a sigmoid. We show how analog neurons with such activation functions can be used to create an analog LSTM cell; networks of these cells can then be trained with standard backpropagation. We train these LSTM networks on a noisy and noiseless version of the original sequence prediction task from Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber (1997), and also on a noisy and noiseless version of a classical working memory reinforcement learning task, the T-Maze.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks trained on large supervised datasets have led to impressive results in recent years. However, since well-annotated datasets can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to collect, recent work has explored the use of larger but noisy datasets that can be more easily obtained. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of deep neural networks on training sets with massively noisy labels. We show on multiple datasets such as MINST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet that successful learning is possible even with an essentially arbitrary amount of noise. For example, on MNIST we find that accuracy of above 90 percent is still attainable even when the dataset has been diluted with 100 noisy examples for each clean example. Such behavior holds across multiple patterns of label noise, even when noisy labels are biased towards confusing classes. Further, we show how the required dataset size for successful training increases with higher label noise. Finally, we present simple actionable techniques for improving learning in the regime of high label noise.",

Deep network distillation seeks to train a smaller network that matches soft-max performance of a larger network.  While both regimes have led to impressive performance for their respective goals, neither provide insight into the importance of a given layer in the original model, which is useful if we are to improve our understanding of these highly parameterized models.  In this paper, we present the concept of deep net triage, which individually assesses small blocks of convolution layers to understand their collective contribution to the overall performance, which we call \\emph{criticality}.  We call it triage because we assess this criticality by answering the question: what is the impact to the health of the overall network if we compress a block of layers into a single layer.\nWe propose a suite of triage methods and compare them on problem spaces of varying complexity.  We ultimately show that, across these problem spaces, deep net triage is able to indicate the of relative importance of different layers.  Surprisingly, our local structural compression technique also leads to an improvement in overall accuracy when the final model is fine-tuned globally.",

    "abstract": "Program synthesis is a class of regression problems where one seeks a solution, in the form of a source-code program, that maps the inputs to their corresponding outputs exactly. Due to its precise and combinatorial nature, it is commonly formulated as a constraint satisfaction problem, where input-output examples are expressed constraints, and solved with a constraint solver. A key challenge of this formulation is that of scalability: While constraint solvers work well with few well-chosen examples, constraining the entire set of example constitutes a significant overhead in both time and memory. In this paper we address this challenge by constructing a representative subset of examples that is both small and is able to constrain the solver sufficiently. We build the subset one example at a time, using a trained discriminator to predict the probability of unchosen input-output examples conditioned on the chosen input-output examples, adding the least probable example to the subset. Experiment on a diagram drawing domain shows our approach produces subset of examples that are small and representative for the constraint solver.",

It is closely related to sequence-to-sequence models, which learn fixed-sized latent representations for sequences, and have been applied to a number of challenging supervised sequence tasks such as machine translation, as well as unsupervised representation learning for sequences.\nIn contrast to sequences, sets are permutation invariant. The proposed set autoencoder considers this fact, both with respect to the input as well as the output of the model. On the input side, we adapt a recently-introduced recurrent neural architecture using a content-based attention mechanism. On the output side, we use a stable marriage algorithm to align predictions to labels in the learning phase.\nWe train the model on synthetic data sets of point clouds and show that the learned representations change smoothly with translations in the inputs, preserve distances in the inputs, and that the set size is represented directly. We apply the model to supervised tasks on the point clouds using the fixed-size latent representation. For a number of difficult classification problems, the results are better than those of a model that does not consider the permutation invariance.

Although GANs can learn a rich representation of the covered modes of the data in their latent space, the framework misses an inverse mapping from data to this latent space. We propose Invariant Encoding Generative Adversarial Networks (IVE-GANs), a novel GAN framework that introduces such a mapping for individual samples from the data by utilizing features in the data which are invariant to certain transformations. Since the model maps individual samples to the latent space, it naturally encourages the generator to cover all modes.

In particular, how to evaluate a learned generative model is unclear.\nIn this paper, we argue that *adversarial learning*, pioneered with generative adversarial networks (GANs), provides an interesting framework to implicitly define more meaningful task losses for unsupervised tasks, such as for generating \"visually realistic\" images. By relating GANs and structured prediction under the framework of statistical decision theory, we put into light links between recent advances in structured prediction theory and the choice of the divergence in GANs. We argue that the insights about the notions of \"hard\" and \"easy\" to learn losses can be analogously extended to adversarial divergences. We also discuss the attractive properties of parametric adversarial divergences for generative modeling, and perform experiments to show the importance of choosing a divergence that reflects the final task.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for learning discriminative and sparse representations. It consists of utilizing two different models. A predefined number of non-linear transform models are used in the learning stage, and one sparsifying transform model is used at test time. The non-linear transform models have discriminative and minimum information loss priors. A novel measure related to the discriminative prior is proposed and defined on the support intersection for the transform representations. The minimum information loss prior is expressed as a constraint on the conditioning and the expected coherence of the transform matrix. An equivalence between the non-linear models and the sparsifying model is shown only when the measure that is used to define the discriminative prior goes to zero. An approximation of the measure used in the discriminative prior is addressed, connecting it to a similarity concentration. To quantify the discriminative properties of the transform representation, we introduce another measure and present its bounds. Reflecting the discriminative quality of the transform representation we name it as discrimination power. \n\nTo support and validate the theoretical analysis a practical learning algorithm is presented. We evaluate the advantages and the potential of the proposed algorithm by a computer simulation. A favorable performance is shown considering the execution time, the quality of the representation, measured by the discrimination power and the recognition accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods of the same category.",

We propose the information geometric Seq2Seq (GeoSeq2Seq) network which abridges the gap between deep recurrent neural networks and information geometry. Specifically, the latent embedding offered by a recurrent network is encoded as a Fisher kernel of a parametric Gaussian Mixture Model, a formalism common in computer vision. We utilise such a network to predict the shortest routes between two nodes of a graph by learning the adjacency matrix using the GeoSeq2Seq formalism; our results show that for such a problem the probabilistic representation of the latent embedding supersedes the non-probabilistic embedding by 10-15\\%.",

    "abstract": "The task of Reading Comprehension with Multiple Choice Questions, requires a human (or machine) to read a given \\{\\textit{passage, question}\\} pair and select one of the $n$ given options. The current state of the art model for this task first computes a query-aware representation for the passage and then \\textit{selects} the option which has the maximum similarity with this representation. However, when humans perform this task they do not just focus on option selection but use a combination of \\textit{elimination} and \\textit{selection}. Specifically, a human would first try to eliminate the most irrelevant option and then read the document again in the light of this new information (and perhaps ignore portions corresponding to the eliminated option). This process could be repeated multiple times till the reader is finally ready to select the correct option. We propose \\textit{ElimiNet}, a neural network based model which tries to mimic this process. Specifically, it has gates which decide whether an option can be eliminated given the \\{\\textit{document, question}\\} pair and if so it tries to make the document representation orthogonal to this eliminatedd option (akin to ignoring portions of the document corresponding to the eliminated option). The model makes multiple rounds of partial elimination to refine the document representation and finally uses a selection module to pick the best option. We evaluate our model on the recently released large scale RACE dataset and show that it outperforms the current state of the art model on 7 out of the 13 question types in this dataset. Further we show that taking an ensemble of our \\textit{elimination-selection} based method with a \\textit{selection} based method gives us an improvement of 7\\% (relative) over the best reported performance on this dataset.    \n",

It is difficult to learn neural networks which will generalize to problem instances that are much larger than those used during training. Furthermore, even when the learned neural program empirically works on all test inputs, we cannot verify that it will work on every possible input. Recent work has shown that it is possible to address these issues by using recursion in the Neural Programmer-Interpreter, but this technique requires a verification set which is difficult to construct without knowledge of the internals of the oracle used to generate training data. In this work, we show how to automatically build such a verification set, which can also be directly used for training. By interactively querying an oracle, we can construct this set with minimal additional knowledge about the oracle. We empirically demonstrate that our method allows automated learning and verification of a recursive NPI program with provably perfect generalization.\n",

    "abstract": "We study the properties of common loss surfaces through their Hessian matrix. In particular, in the context of deep learning, we empirically show that the spectrum of the Hessian is composed of two parts: (1) the bulk centered near zero, (2) and outliers away from the bulk. We present numerical evidence and mathematical justifications to the following conjectures laid out by Sagun et. al. (2016): Fixing data, increasing the number of parameters merely scales the bulk of the spectrum; fixing the dimension and changing the data (for instance adding more clusters or making the data less separable) only affects the outliers. We believe that our observations have striking implications for non-convex optimization in high dimensions. First, the *flatness* of such landscapes (which can be measured by the singularity of the Hessian) implies that classical notions of basins of attraction may be quite misleading. And that the discussion of wide/narrow basins may be in need of a new perspective around over-parametrization and redundancy that are able to create *large* connected components at the bottom of the landscape. Second, the dependence of a small number of large eigenvalues to the data distribution can be linked to the spectrum of the covariance matrix of gradients of model outputs. With this in mind, we may reevaluate the connections within the data-architecture-algorithm framework of a model, hoping that it would shed light on the geometry of high-dimensional and non-convex spaces in modern applications. In particular, we present a case that links the two observations: small and large batch gradient descent appear to converge to different basins of attraction but we show that they are in fact connected through their flat region and so belong to the same basin.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade a wide spectrum of machine learning models have been developed to model the neurodegenerative diseases, associating biomarkers, especially non-intrusive neuroimaging markers, with key clinical scores measuring the cognitive status of patients. Multi-task learning (MTL) has been extensively explored in these studies to address challenges associated to high dimensionality and small cohort size. However, most existing MTL approaches are based on linear models and suffer from two major limitations: 1) they cannot explicitly consider upper/lower bounds in these clinical scores; 2) they lack the capability to capture complicated non-linear effects among the variables. In this paper, we propose the Subspace Network, an efficient deep modeling approach for non-linear multi-task censored regression. Each layer of the subspace network performs a multi-task censored regression to improve upon the predictions from the last layer via sketching a low-dimensional subspace to perform knowledge transfer among learning tasks. We show that under mild assumptions, for each layer the parametric subspace can be recovered using only one pass of training data. In addition, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed subspace network quickly picks up correct parameter subspaces, and outperforms state-of-the-arts in predicting neurodegenerative clinical scores using information in brain imaging.

In our analysis, we find out although currently second-order methods are too slow to be applied in practice, it can reduce training loss in fewer number of iterations compared with SGD. In addition, we have the following interesting findings: (1) When using a large batch size, inexact-Newton methods will converge much faster than SGD. Therefore inexact-Newton method could be a better choice in distributed training of deep networks. (2) Quasi-newton methods are competitive with SGD even when using ReLu activation function (which has no curvature) on residual networks. However, current methods are too sensitive to parameters and not easy to tune for different settings.

    "abstract": "We propose Significance-Offset Convolutional Neural Network, a deep convolutional network architecture for regression of multivariate asynchronous time series.  The model is inspired by standard autoregressive (AR) models and gating mechanisms used in recurrent neural networks.  It involves an AR-like weighting system, where the final predictor is obtained as a weighted sum of adjusted regressors, while the weights are data-dependent functions learnt through a convolutional network. The architecture was designed for applications on asynchronous time series and is evaluated on such datasets: a hedge fund proprietary dataset of over 2 million quotes for a credit derivative index, an artificially generated noisy autoregressive  series  and  household  electricity  consumption  dataset.   The  pro-posed architecture achieves promising results as compared to convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The code for the numerical experiments and the architecture implementation will be shared online to make the research reproducible.",

Then the learned parameters are used as the initial parameters to retrain disjoint classification networks. The baseline recognition model are all-convolution neural networks.

With multi-task learning to pre-train the networks, the recognition accuracies are respectively 99.70\\%, 97.46\\% and 95.25\\%.

    "abstract": "Asking questions is an important ability for a chatbot. This paper focuses on question generation. Although there are existing works on question generation based on a piece of descriptive text, it remains to be a very challenging problem. In the paper, we propose a new question generation problem, which also requires the input of a target topic in addition to a piece of descriptive text. The key reason for proposing the new problem is that in practical applications, we found that useful questions need to be targeted toward some relevant topics. One almost never asks a random question in a conversation. Due to the fact that given a descriptive text, it is often possible to ask many types of questions, generating a question without knowing what it is about is of limited use. To solve the problem, we propose a novel neural network that is able to generate topic-specific questions. One major advantage of this model is that it can be trained directly using a question-answering corpus without requiring any additional annotations like annotating topics in the questions or answers. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that deep neural networks are extremely vulnerable to adversarial examples which are semantically indistinguishable from natural data and yet incorrectly classified. These adversarial examples are generated from the natural data by adding a small amount of adversarial perturbation. This paper tackles the adversarial attack problem with hyperspherical defense - a defense strategy that learns neural network over hyperspheres. The hyperspherical defense framework is well motivated by: (i) Learning on hyperspheres gives us bounded output, which may make the geometry of neural networks more smooth; (ii) Learning on hyperspheres could naturally eliminate some adversarial perturbations and reduce the effect of adversarial perturbations; (iii) Representing data on hyperspheres selectively drops some information of the inputs, but these information are shown to be not crucial to visual recognition (based on the fact that hyperspherical neural network performs comparable to or even better than standard neural networks in visual recognition). Furthermore, we introduce the hyperspherical compactness and propose a robust geodesic inference. We also provide theoretical insights about why our hyperspherical defense improves robustness. Last, we validate the superiority of hyperspherical defense with extensive experiments on both white-box and black-box adversarial attacks on multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "We introduce an unsupervised structure learning algorithm for deep, feed-forward, neural networks. We propose a new interpretation for depth and inter-layer connectivity where a hierarchy of independencies in the input distribution is encoded in the network structure. This results in structures allowing neurons to connect to neurons in any deeper layer skipping intermediate layers. Moreover, neurons in deeper layers encode low-order (small condition sets) independencies and have a wide scope of the input, whereas neurons in the first layers encode higher-order (larger condition sets) independencies and have a narrower scope. Thus, the depth of the network is automatically determined---equal to the maximal order of independence in the input distribution, which is the recursion-depth of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm constructs two main graphical models: 1) a generative latent graph (a deep belief network) learned from data and 2) a deep discriminative graph constructed from the generative latent graph. We prove that conditional dependencies between the nodes in the learned generative latent graph are preserved in the class-conditional discriminative graph. Finally, a deep neural network structure is constructed based on the discriminative graph. We demonstrate on image classification benchmarks that the algorithm replaces the deepest layers (convolutional and dense layers) of common convolutional networks, achieving high classification accuracy, while constructing significantly smaller structures. The proposed structure learning algorithm requires a small computational cost and runs efficiently on a standard desktop CPU.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a mix-generator generative adversarial networks (PGAN) model that works in parallel by mixing multiple disjoint generators to approximate a complex real distribution. In our model, we propose an adjustment component that collects all the generated data points from the generators, learns the boundary between each pair of generators, and provides error to separate the support of each of the generated distributions. To overcome the instability in a multiplayer game, a shrinkage adjustment component method is introduced to gradually reduce the boundary between generators during the training procedure. To address the linearly growing training time problem in a multiple generators model, we propose a method to train the generators in parallel. This means that our work can be scaled up to large parallel computation frameworks. We present an efficient loss function for the discriminator, an effective adjustment component, and a suitable generator. We also show how to introduce the decay factor to stabilize the training procedure. We have performed extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, MNIST, and CIFAR-10. These experiments reveal that the error provided by the adjustment component could successfully separate the generated distributions and each of the generators can stably learn a part of the real distribution even if only a few modes are contained in the real distribution.",

In particular, tensor networks (TNs) and deep learning architectures bear striking similarities to the extent that TNs can be used for machine learning. Previous results used one-dimensional TNs in image recognition, showing limited scalability and a request of high bond dimension. In this work, we train two-dimensional hierarchical TNs to solve image recognition problems, using a training algorithm derived from the multipartite entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA). This approach overcomes scalability issues and implies novel mathematical connections among quantum many-body physics, quantum information theory, and machine learning. While keeping the TN unitary in the training phase, TN states can be defined, which optimally encodes each class of the images into a quantum many-body state. We study the quantum features of the TN states, including quantum entanglement and fidelity. We suggest these quantities could be novel properties that characterize the image classes, as well as the machine learning tasks. Our work could be further applied to identifying possible quantum properties of certain artificial intelligence methods.",

Despite its outstanding performance in classification tasks, the features derived from the supervision of softmax are usually sub-optimal in some scenarios where Euclidean distances apply in feature spaces. To address this issue, we propose a new loss, dubbed the isotropic loss, in the sense that the overall distribution of data points is regularized to approach the isotropic normal one. Combined with the vanilla softmax, we formalize a novel criterion called the isotropic softmax, or isomax for short, for supervised learning of deep neural networks. By virtue of the isomax, the intra-class features are penalized by the isotropic loss while inter-class distances are well kept by the original softmax loss. Moreover, the isomax loss does not require any additional modifications to the network, mini-batches or the training process. Extensive experiments on classification and clustering are performed to demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the isomax loss.",

Unfortunately, many of such measures, like the mutual information, are hard to estimate and optimize directly.  We propose to learn independent features with adversarial objectives (Goodfellow et al. 2014, Arjovsky et al. 2017) which optimize such measures implicitly.  These objectives compare samples from the joint distribution and the product of the marginals without the need to compute any probability densities. We also propose two methods for obtaining samples from the product of the marginals using either a simple resampling trick or a separate parametric distribution.  Our experiments show that this strategy can easily be applied to different types of model architectures and solve both linear and non-linear ICA problems.\n",

However, GCN computes nodes' representation recursively from their neighbors, making the receptive field size grow exponentially with the number of layers.  Previous attempts on reducing the receptive field size by subsampling neighbors do not have any convergence guarantee, and their receptive field size per node is still in the order of hundreds. In this paper, we develop a preprocessing strategy and two control variate based algorithms to further reduce the receptive field size. Our algorithms are guaranteed to converge to GCN's local optimum regardless of the neighbor sampling size. Empirical results show that our algorithms have a similar convergence speed per epoch with the exact algorithm even using only two neighbors per node. The time consumption of our algorithm on the Reddit dataset is only one fifth of previous neighbor sampling algorithms.",

Policy gradient methods usually predict one continuous action estimate or parameters of a presumed distribution (most commonly Gaussian) for any given state which might not be optimal as it may not capture the complete description of the target distribution. Our approach instead predicts M actions with the policy network (actor) and then uniformly sample one action during training as well as testing at each state. This allows the agent to learn a simple stochastic policy that has an easy to compute expected return. In all experiments, this facilitates better exploration of the state space during training and converges to a better policy. ",

    "abstract": "The ability of an agent to {\\em discover} its own learning objectives has long been considered a key ingredient for artificial general intelligence. Breakthroughs in autonomous decision making and reinforcement learning have primarily been in domains where the agent's goal is outlined and clear: such as playing a game to win, or driving safely. Several studies have demonstrated that learning extramural sub-tasks and auxiliary predictions can improve (1) single human-specified task learning, (2) transfer of learning, (3) and the agent's learned representation of the world. In all these examples, the agent was instructed what to learn about. We investigate a framework for discovery: curating a large collection of predictions, which are used to construct the agent's representation of the world. Specifically, our system maintains a large collection of predictions, continually pruning and replacing predictions. We highlight the importance of considering stability rather than convergence for such a system, and develop an adaptive, regularized algorithm towards that aim. We provide several experiments in computational micro-worlds demonstrating that this simple approach can be effective for discovering useful predictions autonomously.",

    "abstract": "The quality of a machine translation system depends largely on the availability of sizable parallel corpora. For the recently popular Neural Machine Translation (NMT) framework, data sparsity problem can become even more severe. With large amount of tunable parameters, the NMT model may overfit to the existing language pairs while failing to understand the general diversity in language. In this paper, we advocate to broadcast every sentence pair as two groups of similar sentences to incorporate more diversity in language expressions, which we name as parallel cluster. Then we define a more general cluster-to-cluster correspondence score and train our model to maximize this score. Since direct maximization is difficult, we derive its lower-bound as our surrogate objective, which is found to generalize point-point Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and point-to-cluster Reward Augmented Maximum Likelihood (RAML) algorithms as special cases. Based on this novel objective function, we delineate four potential systems to realize our cluster-to-cluster framework and test their performances in three recognized translation tasks, each task with forward and reverse translation directions. In each of the six experiments, our proposed four parallel systems have consistently proved to outperform the MLE baseline, RL (Reinforcement Learning) and RAML systems significantly. Finally, we have performed case study to empirically analyze the strength of the cluster-to-cluster NMT framework. ",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in designing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is decoding behavior from time-varying neural oscillations. In typical applications, decoders are constructed for individual subjects and with limited data leading to restrictions on the types of models that can be utilized. Currently, the best performing decoders are typically linear models capable of utilizing rigid timing constraints with limited training data. Here we demonstrate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to take advantage of the temporal information present in sequential neural data collected from subjects implanted with electrocorticographic (ECoG) electrode arrays performing a finger flexion task. Our constructed models are capable of achieving accuracies that are comparable to existing techniques while also being robust to variation in sample data size. Moreover, we utilize the LSTM networks and an affine transformation layer to construct a novel architecture for transfer learning. We demonstrate that in scenarios where only the affine transform is learned for a new subject, it is possible to achieve results comparable to existing state-of-the-art techniques. The notable advantage is the increased stability of the model during training on novel subjects. Relaxing the constraint of only training the affine transformation, we establish our model as capable of exceeding performance of current models across all training data sizes. Overall, this work demonstrates that LSTMs are a versatile model that can accurately capture temporal patterns in neural data and can provide a foundation for transfer learning in neural decoding.",

Such advantages can potentially lead to gains in both speed and performance, but multitask networks are also difficult to train without finding the right balance between tasks. We present a novel gradient normalization (GradNorm) technique which automatically balances the multitask loss function by directly tuning the gradients to equalize task training rates. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting over single networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process which incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we hope to demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the combination of feedforward and iterative computations in the visual cortex, and taking advantage of the ability of denoising autoencoders to estimate the score of a joint distribution, we propose a novel approach to iterative inference for capturing and exploiting the complex joint distribution of output variables conditioned on some input variables. This approach is applied to image pixel-wise segmentation, with the estimated conditional score used to perform gradient ascent towards a mode of the estimated conditional distribution. This extends previous work on score estimation by denoising autoencoders to the case of a conditional distribution, with a novel use of a corrupted feedforward predictor replacing Gaussian corruption. An advantage of this approach over more classical ways to perform iterative inference for structured outputs, like conditional random fields (CRFs), is that it is not any more necessary to define an explicit energy function linking the output variables. To keep computations tractable, such energy function parametrizations are typically fairly constrained, involving only a few neighbors of each of the output variables in each clique. We experimentally find that the proposed iterative inference from conditional score estimation by conditional denoising autoencoders performs better than comparable models based on CRFs or those not using any explicit modeling of the conditional joint distribution of outputs.",

Here we develop GraphWave, a method that represents each node\u2019s local network neighborhood via a low-dimensional embedding by leveraging spectral graph wavelet diffusion patterns. We prove that nodes with similar local network neighborhoods will have similar GraphWave embeddings even though these nodes may reside in very different parts of the network.

We show that the rate of signSGD to reach first-order critical points matches that of SGD in terms of number of stochastic gradient calls, up to roughly a linear factor in the dimension.

Unlike previous multi-generator models use a subsequent generation process, that one layer is generated given the previous layer, our model uses a process of generating different part of the images together. This way the model contains fewer parameters and the generation speed is faster. Speci\ufb01cally, the model leverages the label information to separate the object from the image correctly. Since the model conditional on the label information does not restrict to generate other parts of an image, we proposed a cost function that encourages the model to generate only the succinct part of an image in terms of label discrimination. We also found an exclusive prior on the mask of the model help separate the object.

We propose a novel technique that significantly improves prediction quality on users\u2019 language compared to a general model and outperforms gradient compression methods in terms of communication efficiency. The proposed procedure is fast and leads to an almost 70% perplexity reduction and 8.7 percentage point improvement in keystroke saving rate on informal English texts.

    "abstract": "Graph classification is currently dominated by graph kernels, which, while powerful, suffer some significant limitations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer a very appealing alternative. However, processing graphs with CNNs is not trivial. To address this challenge, many sophisticated extensions of CNNs have recently been proposed. In this paper, we reverse the problem: rather than proposing yet another graph CNN model, we introduce a novel way to represent graphs as multi-channel image-like structures that allows them to be handled by vanilla 2D CNNs. Despite its simplicity, our method proves very competitive to state-of-the-art graph kernels and graph CNNs, and outperforms them by a wide margin on some datasets. It is also preferable to graph kernels in terms of time complexity. Code and data are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) had great success on NLP tasks such as language modeling, machine translation and certain question answering (QA) tasks. However, the success is limited at more knowledge intensive tasks such as QA from a big corpus. Existing end-to-end deep QA models (Miller et al., 2016; Weston et al., 2014) need to read the entire text after observing the question, and therefore their complexity in responding a question is linear in the text size. This is prohibitive for practical tasks such as QA from Wikipedia, a novel, or the Web. We propose to solve this scalability issue by using symbolic meaning representations, which can be indexed and retrieved efficiently with complexity that is independent of the text size. More specifically, we use sequence-to-sequence models to encode knowledge symbolically and generate programs to answer questions from the encoded knowledge. We apply our approach, called the N-Gram Machine (NGM), to the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2015) and a special version of them (\u201clife-long bAbI\u201d) which has stories of up to 10 million sentences. Our experiments show that NGM can successfully solve both of these tasks accurately and efficiently. Unlike fully differentiable memory models, NGM\u2019s time complexity and answering quality are not affected by the story length. The whole system of NGM is trained end-to-end with REINFORCE (Williams, 1992). To avoid high variance in gradient estimation, which is typical in discrete latent variable models, we use beam search instead of sampling. To tackle the exponentially large search space, we use a stabilized auto-encoding objective and a structure tweak procedure to iteratively reduce and refine the search space.\n",

    "abstract": "We present a method for evaluating the sensitivity of deep reinforcement learning (RL) policies. We also formulate a zero-sum dynamic game for designing robust deep reinforcement learning policies. Our approach mitigates the brittleness of policies when agents are trained in a simulated environment and are later exposed to the real world where it is hazardous to employ RL policies. This framework for training deep RL policies involve a zero-sum  dynamic game against an adversarial agent, where the goal is to drive the system dynamics to a saddle region. Using a variant of the guided policy search algorithm, our agent learns to adopt robust policies that require less samples for learning the dynamics and performs better than the GPS algorithm. Without loss of generality, we demonstrate that deep RL policies trained in this fashion will be maximally robust to a ``worst\" possible adversarial disturbances.",

Conventional approaches rely on numerical methods to estimate the pollutant concentration and require lots of computing power. To solve this problem, we applied the widely used deep learning methods.

In this paper, we introduced a new dataset, entitled as AirNet, containing the 0.25 degree resolution grid map of mainland China, with more than two years of continued air quality measurement and meteorological data. We published this dataset as an open resource for machine learning researches and set up a baseline of a 5-day air pollution forecast.

We also investigate the effects of pre-defining the sparsity of networks with only fully connected layers.

However, since reparameterization trick only works on continuous variables, deep generative models with discrete latent variables still remain hard to train and perform considerably worse than their continuous counterparts. In this paper, we attempt to shrink this gap by introducing a new architecture and its learning procedure.  We develop a hybrid generative model with binary latent variables that consists of an undirected graphical model and a deep neural network. We propose an efficient two-stage pretraining and training procedure that is crucial for learning these models.

However, in real life expert demonstrations, often the action information is missing and only state trajectories are available. We present a model-based imitation learning method that can learn environment-specific optimal actions only from expert state trajectories. Our proposed method starts with a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm with a heuristic reward signal to sample environment dynamics, which is then used to train the state-transition probability. Subsequently, we learn the optimal actions from expert state trajectories by supervised learning, while back-propagating the error gradients through the modeled environment dynamics. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method successfully achieves performance similar to (state, action) trajectory-based traditional imitation learning methods even in the absence of action information, with much fewer iterations compared to conventional model-free reinforcement learning methods. We also demonstrate that our method can learn to act from only video demonstrations of expert agent for simple games and can learn to achieve desired performance in less number of iterations.",

We found that, in each region, the loss surface have properties similar to that of linear neural networks where every local minimum is a global minimum. This means that every differentiable local minimum is the global minimum of the corresponding region.

    "abstract": "Multi-view recognition is the task of classifying an object from multi-view image sequences. Instead of using a single-view for classification, humans generally navigate around a target object to learn its multi-view representation. Motivated by this human behavior, the next best view can be learned by combining object recognition with navigation in complex environments. Since deep reinforcement learning has proven successful in navigation tasks, we propose a novel multi-task reinforcement learning framework for joint multi-view recognition and navigation. Our method uses a hierarchical action space for multi-task reinforcement learning. The framework was evaluated with an environment created from the ModelNet40 dataset. Our results show improvements on object recognition and demonstrate human-like behavior on navigation.",

    "abstract": "We capitalize on the natural compositional structure of images in order to learn object segmentation with weakly labeled images. The intuition behind our approach is that removing objects from images will yield natural images, however removing random patches will yield unnatural images. We leverage this signal to develop a generative model that decomposes an image into layers, and when all layers are combined, it reconstructs the input image. However, when a layer is removed, the model learns to produce a different image that still looks natural to an adversary, which is possible by removing objects. Experiments and visualizations suggest that this model automatically learns object segmentation on images labeled only by scene better than baselines.",

    "abstract": "Within-class variation in a high-dimensional dataset can be modeled as being on a low-dimensional manifold due to the constraints of the physical processes producing that variation (e.g., translation, illumination, etc.). We desire a method for learning a representation of the manifolds induced by identity-preserving transformations that can be used to increase robustness, reduce the training burden, and encourage interpretability in machine learning tasks. In particular, what is needed is a representation of the transformation manifold that can robustly capture the shape of the manifold from the input data, generate new points on the manifold, and extend transformations outside of the training domain without significantly increasing the error. Previous work has proposed algorithms to efficiently learn analytic operators (called transport operators) that define the process of transporting one data point on a manifold to another.  The main contribution of this paper is to define two transfer learning methods that use this generative manifold representation to learn natural transformations and incorporate them into new data. The first method uses this representation in a novel randomized approach to transfer learning that employs the learned generative model to map out unseen regions of the data space. These results are shown through demonstrations of transfer learning in a data augmentation task for few-shot image classification. The second method use of transport operators for injecting specific transformations into new data examples which allows for realistic image animation and informed data augmentation.  These results are shown on stylized constructions using the classic swiss roll data structure and in demonstrations of transfer learning in a data augmentation task for few-shot image classification. We also propose the use of transport operators for injecting transformations into new data examples which allows for realistic image animation.",

There are at least two challenges in handling NEs using neural methods in such settings: individual NEs may occur only rarely making it hard to learn good representations of them, and many of the Out Of Vocabulary words that occur during test time may be NEs. Thus, the need to interact well with these NEs has emerged as a serious challenge to building neural methods for goal-oriented dialog tasks. In this paper, we propose a new neural method for this problem, and present empirical evaluations on a structured Question answering task and three related goal-oriented dialog tasks that show that our proposed method can be effective in interacting with NEs in these settings.",

Goal-oriented tasks are among the most typical problems in this domain, where a reward can only be received when the final goal is accomplished. In this work, we propose a potential solution to such problems with the introduction of an experience-based tendency reward mechanism, which provides the agent with additional hints based on a discriminative learning on past experiences during an automated reverse curriculum. This mechanism not only provides dense additional learning signals on what states lead to success, but also allows the agent to retain only this tendency reward instead of the whole histories of experience during multi-phase curriculum learning. We extensively study the advantages of our method on the standard sparse reward domains like Maze and Super Mario Bros and show that our method performs more efficiently and robustly than prior approaches in tasks with long time horizons and large state space. In addition, we demonstrate that using an optional keyframe scheme with very small quantity of key states, our approach can solve difficult robot manipulation challenges directly from perception and sparse rewards.",

    "abstract": "Variational autoencoders (VAE) learn probabilistic latent variable models by optimizing a bound on the marginal likelihood of the observed data. Beyond providing a good density model a VAE model assigns to each data instance a latent code. In many applications, this latent code provides a useful high-level summary of the observation. However, the VAE may fail to learn a useful representation when the decoder family is very expressive. This is because maximum likelihood does not explicitly encourage useful representations and the latent variable is used only if it helps model the marginal distribution. This makes representation learning with VAEs unreliable. To address this issue, we propose a method for explicitly controlling the amount of information stored in the latent code. Our method can learn codes ranging from independent to nearly deterministic while benefiting from decoder capacity. Thus, we decouple the choice of decoder capacity and the latent code dimensionality from the amount of information stored in the code.\n",

In this paper, we propose to generate sample-specific filters for convolutional layers in the forward pass. Since the filters are generated on-the-fly, the model becomes more flexible and can better fit the training data compared to traditional CNNs. In order to obtain sample-specific features, we extract the intermediate feature maps from an autoencoder. As filters are usually high dimensional, we propose to learn a set of coefficients instead of a set of filters. These coefficients are used to linearly combine the base filters from a filter repository to generate the final filters for a CNN.

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, it is common to let an agent interact with its environment for a fixed amount of time before resetting the environment and repeating the process in a series of episodes. The task that the agent has to learn can either be to maximize its performance over (i) that fixed amount of time, or (ii) an indefinite period where the time limit is only used during training. In this paper, we investigate theoretically how time limits could effectively be handled in each of the two cases. In the first one, we argue that the terminations due to time limits are in fact part of the environment, and propose to include a notion of the remaining time as part of the agent's input. In the second case, the time limits are not part of the environment and are only used to facilitate learning. We argue that such terminations should not be treated as environmental ones and propose a method, specific to value-based algorithms, that incorporates this insight by continuing to bootstrap at the end of each partial episode. To illustrate the significance of our proposals, we perform several experiments on a range of environments from simple few-state transition graphs to complex control tasks, including novel and standard benchmark domains. Our results show that the proposed methods improve the performance and stability of existing reinforcement learning algorithms.",

Instead of proposing yet another architecture, this  paper aims to provide an understanding of some of the basic issues surrounding GANs. First, we propose a natural way of specifying the loss function for GANs by drawing a connection with supervised learning. Second, we shed light on the statistical performance of GANs through the analysis of a simple LQG setting: the generator is linear, the loss function is quadratic and the data is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. We show that  in this setting: 1) the optimal GAN solution converges to population Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as the number of training samples increases; 2) the number of samples required scales exponentially with the dimension of the data; 3) the number of samples scales almost linearly if the discriminator is constrained to be quadratic. Moreover, under this quadratic constraint on the discriminator, the optimal finite-sample GAN performs simply empirical PCA.",

    "abstract": "Policy gradients methods often achieve better performance when the change in policy is limited to a small Kullback-Leibler divergence. We derive policy gradients where the change in policy is limited to a small Wasserstein distance (or trust region). This is done in the discrete and continuous multi-armed bandit settings with entropy regularisation. We show that in the small steps limit with respect to the Wasserstein distance $W_2$, policy dynamics are governed by the heat equation, following the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto result. This means that policies undergo diffusion and advection, concentrating near actions with high reward. This helps elucidate the nature of convergence in the probability matching setup, and provides justification for empirical practices such as Gaussian policy priors and additive gradient noise.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new deep convolutional neural network, CrescendoNet, by stacking simple building blocks without residual connections. Each Crescendo block contains independent convolution paths with increased depths. The numbers of convolution layers and parameters are only increased linearly in Crescendo blocks. In experiments, CrescendoNet with only 15 layers outperforms almost all networks without residual connections on benchmark datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN. Given sufficient amount of data as in SVHN dataset, CrescendoNet with 15 layers and 4.1M parameters can match the performance of DenseNet-BC with 250 layers and 15.3M parameters. CrescendoNet provides a new way to construct high performance deep convolutional neural networks without residual connections. Moreover, through investigating the behavior and performance of subnetworks in CrescendoNet, we note that the high performance of CrescendoNet may come from its implicit ensemble behavior, which differs from the FractalNet that is also a deep convolutional neural network without residual connections. Furthermore, the independence between paths in CrescendoNet allows us to introduce a new path-wise training procedure, which can reduce the memory needed for training.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an information theoretic co-training objective for unsupervised learning.  We consider the problem of predicting the future. Rather than predict future sensations (image pixels or sound waves) we predict ``hypotheses'' to be confirmed by future sensations. More formally, we assume a population distribution on pairs $(x,y)$ where we can think of $x$ as a past sensation and $y$ as a future sensation. We train both a predictor model $P_\\Phi(z|x)$ and a confirmation model $P_\\Psi(z|y)$ where we view $z$ as hypotheses (when predicted) or facts (when confirmed). For a population distribution on pairs $(x,y)$ we focus on the problem of measuring the mutual information between $x$ and $y$. By the data processing inequality this mutual information is at least as large as the mutual information between $x$ and $z$ under the distribution on triples $(x,z,y)$ defined by the confirmation model $P_\\Psi(z|y)$. The information theoretic training objective for $P_\\Phi(z|x)$ and $P_\\Psi(z|y)$ can be viewed as a form of co-training where we want the prediction from $x$ to match the confirmation from $y$.

    "abstract": "Building deep neural networks to control autonomous agents which have to interact in real-time with the physical world, such as robots or automotive vehicles, requires a seamless integration of time into a network\u2019s architecture. The central question of this work is, how the temporal nature of reality should be reflected in the execution of a deep neural network and its components. Most artificial deep neural networks are partitioned into a directed graph of connected modules or layers and the layers themselves consist of elemental building blocks, such as single units. For most deep neural networks, all units of a layer are processed synchronously and in parallel, but layers themselves are processed in a sequential manner. In contrast, all elements of a biological neural network are processed in parallel. In this paper, we define a class of networks between these two extreme cases. These networks are executed in a streaming or synchronous layerwise-parallel manner, unlocking the layers of such networks for parallel processing. Compared to the standard layerwise-sequential deep networks, these new layerwise-parallel networks show a fundamentally different temporal behavior and flow of information, especially for networks with skip or recurrent connections. We argue that layerwise-parallel deep networks are better suited for future challenges of deep neural network design, such as large functional modularized and/or recurrent architectures as well as networks allocating different network capacities dependent on current stimulus and/or task complexity. We layout basic properties and discuss major challenges for layerwise-parallel networks. Additionally, we provide a toolbox to design, train, evaluate, and online-interact with layerwise-parallel networks.",

    "abstract": "For inference operations in deep neural networks on end devices, it is desirable to deploy a single pre-trained neural network model, which can dynamically scale across a computation range without comprising accuracy. To achieve this goal, Incomplete Dot Product (IDP) has been proposed to use only a subset of terms in dot products during forward propagation. However, there are some limitations, including noticeable performance degradation in operating regions with low computational costs, and essential performance limitations since IDP uses hand-crafted profile coefficients. In this paper, we extend IDP by proposing new training algorithms involving a single profile, which may be trainable or pre-determined, to significantly improve the overall performance, especially in operating regions with low computational costs. Specifically, we propose the Task-wise Early Stopping and Loss Aggregation (TESLA) algorithm, which is showed in our 3-layer multilayer perceptron on MNIST that outperforms the original IDP by 32\\% when only 10\\% of dot products terms are used and achieves 94.7\\% accuracy on average. By introducing trainable profile coefficients, TESLA further improves the accuracy to 95.5\\% without specifying coefficients in advance. Besides, TESLA is applied to the VGG-16 model, which achieves 80\\% accuracy using only 20\\% of dot product terms on CIFAR-10 and also keeps 60\\% accuracy using only 30\\% of dot product terms on CIFAR-100, but the original IDP performs like a random guess in these two datasets at such low computation costs. Finally, we visualize the learned representations at different dot product percentages by class activation map and show that, by applying TESLA, the learned representations can adapt over a wide range of operation regions.",

To do this, we build a model of human behavior in the targeted domain from a relatively small set of interactions, and then use this behavioral model as an auxiliary loss function to improve the generative model.

In this article, we analyze neural networks from a frame theoretic perspective to identify the sufficient conditions that enable smoothly recoverable representations of signals in L^2(R). Moreover, we show that, under certain assumptions, these properties hold even when signals are irregularly observed. As we converge to the family of (convolutional) neural networks that satisfy these conditions, we show that we can optimize our convolution filters while constraining them so that they effectively compute a Discrete Wavelet Transform. Such a neural network can efficiently divide the time-axis of a signal into orthogonal sub-spaces of different temporal scale and localization.

While this time-independent view of sequences is applicable for data such as natural languages, e.g., dealing with words in a sentence, it is inappropriate and inefficient for many real world events that are observed and collected at unequally spaced points of time as they naturally arise, e.g., when a person goes to a grocery store or makes a phone call. The time span between events can carry important information about the sequence dependence of human behaviors. In this work, we propose a set of methods for using time in sequence prediction. Because neural sequence models such as RNN are more amenable for handling token-like input, we propose two methods for time-dependent event representation, based on the intuition on how time is tokenized in everyday life and previous work on embedding contextualization. We also introduce two methods for using next event duration as regularization for training a sequence prediction model. We discuss these methods based on recurrent neural nets. We evaluate these methods as well as baseline models on five datasets that resemble a variety of sequence prediction tasks.

Yet, from experiments and analysis in this earlier work, it is not clear what strategies are used by these algorithms in navigating the mazes and finding the goal. In this paper, we pose and study this underlying question: are DRL algorithms doing some form of mapping and/or path-planning? Our experiments show that the algorithms are not memorizing the maps of mazes at the testing stage but, rather, at the training stage. Hence, the DRL algorithms fall short of qualifying as mapping or path-planning algorithms with any reasonable definition of mapping. We extend the experiments in Mirowski et al. (2016) by separating the set of training and testing maps and by a more ablative coverage of the space of experiments. Our systematic experiments show that the NavA3C-D1-D2-L algorithm, when trained and tested on the same maps, is able to choose the shorter paths to the goal. However, when tested on unseen maps the algorithm utilizes a wall-following strategy to find the goal without doing any mapping or path planning.",

We\ncan leverage the structure of the search space to introduce different model search\nalgorithms, such as random search, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), and sequen-\ntial model-based optimization (SMBO). We present experiments comparing the\ndifferent algorithms on CIFAR-10 and show that MCTS and SMBO outperform\nrandom search. We also present experiments on MNIST, showing that the same\nsearch space achieves near state-of-the-art performance with a few samples. These\nexperiments show that our framework can be used effectively for model discov-\nery, as it is possible to describe expressive search spaces and discover competitive\nmodels without much effort from the human expert. Code for our framework and\nexperiments has been made publicly available",

    "abstract": "Hyperparameter tuning is one of the most time-consuming workloads in deep learning. State-of-the-art optimizers, such as AdaGrad, RMSProp and Adam, reduce this labor by adaptively tuning an individual learning rate for each variable. Recently researchers have shown renewed interest in simpler methods like momentum SGD as they may yield better results. Motivated by this trend, we ask: can simple adaptive methods, based on SGD perform as well or better? We revisit the momentum SGD algorithm and show that hand-tuning a single learning rate and momentum makes it competitive with Adam. We then analyze its robustness to learning rate misspecification and objective curvature variation. Based on these insights, we design YellowFin, an automatic tuner for momentum and learning rate in SGD. YellowFin optionally uses a negative-feedback loop to compensate for the momentum dynamics in asynchronous settings on the fly. We empirically show YellowFin can converge in fewer iterations than Adam on ResNets and LSTMs for image recognition, language modeling and constituency parsing, with a speedup of up to $3.28$x in synchronous and up to $2.69$x in asynchronous settings.",

    "abstract": "We propose an unsupervised method for building dynamic representations of sequential data, particularly of observed interactions. The method simultaneously acquires representations of input data and its dynamics. It is based on a hierarchical generative model composed of two levels. In the first level, a model learns representations to generate observed data. In the second level, representational states encode the dynamics of the lower one. The model is designed as a Bayesian network with switching variables represented in the higher level, and which generates transition models. The method actively explores the latent space guided by its knowledge and the uncertainty about it. That is achieved by updating the latent variables from prediction error signals backpropagated to the latent space. So, no encoder or inference models are used since the generators also serve as their inverse transformations.\nThe method is evaluated in two scenarios, with static images and with videos. The results show that the adaptation over time leads to better performance than with similar architectures without temporal dependencies, e.g., variational autoencoders. With videos, it is shown that the system extracts the dynamics of the data in states that highly correlate with the ground truth of the actions observed.",

    "abstract": "Building chatbots that can accomplish goals such as booking a flight ticket is an unsolved problem in natural language understanding. Much progress has been made to build conversation models using techniques such as sequence2sequence modeling. One challenge in applying such techniques to building goal-oriented conversation models is that maximum likelihood-based models are not optimized toward accomplishing goals. Recently, many methods have been proposed to address this issue by optimizing a reward that contains task status or outcome. However, adding the reward optimization on the fly usually provides little guidance for language construction and the conversation model soon becomes decoupled from the language model. In this paper, we propose a new setting in goal-oriented dialogue system to tighten the gap between these two aspects by enforcing model level information isolation on individual models between two agents. Language construction now becomes an important part in reward optimization since it is the only way information can be exchanged. We experimented our models using self-play and results showed that our method not only beat the baseline sequence2sequence model in rewards but can also generate human-readable meaningful conversations of comparable quality.

We evaluate LEAP using deep CNN architectures for the task of supervised image classification on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.

We consider the Single Logit Classification (SLC) task: training the network so that at test-time, it would be possible to accurately identify if the example belongs to a given class, based only on the output logit for this class. \nWe propose a natural principle, the Principle of Logit Separation, as a guideline for choosing and designing losses suitable for the SLC. \nWe show that the cross-entropy loss function is not aligned with the Principle of Logit Separation. In contrast, there are known loss functions, as well as novel batch loss functions that we propose, which are aligned with this principle. In total, we study seven loss functions. \nOur experiments show that indeed in almost all cases, losses that are aligned with Principle of Logit Separation obtain a 20%-35% relative performance improvement in the SLC task, compared to losses that are not aligned with it.

While early detection of sepsis improves patient outcomes, there is little consensus on exact treatment guidelines, and treating septic patients remains an open  problem.  In this work we present a new deep reinforcement learning method that we use to learn optimal personalized treatment policies for septic patients. We model patient continuous-valued physiological time series using multi-output Gaussian processes, a probabilistic model that easily handles missing values and irregularly spaced observation times while maintaining estimates of uncertainty. The Gaussian process is directly tied to a deep recurrent Q-network that learns clinically interpretable treatment policies, and both models are learned together end-to-end.  We evaluate our approach on a heterogeneous dataset of septic spanning 15 months from our university health system, and find that our learned policy could reduce patient mortality by as much as 8.2\\% from an overall baseline mortality rate of 13.3\\%.  Our algorithm could be used to make treatment recommendations to physicians as part of a decision support tool, and the framework readily applies to other reinforcement learning problems that rely on sparsely sampled and frequently missing multivariate time series data.\n",

In this paper, we study the problem of multi-step video prediction, where the goal is to predict a sequence of future frames conditioned on a short context. We focus specifically on two aspects of video prediction: accurately modeling object motion, and producing naturalistic image predictions. Our model is based on a flow-based generator network with a discriminator used to improve prediction quality. The implicit flow in the generator can be examined to determine its accuracy, and the predicted images can be evaluated for image quality. We argue that these two metrics are critical for understanding whether the model has effectively learned object motion, and propose a novel evaluation benchmark based on ground truth object flow. Our network achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both the realism of the predicted images, as determined by human judges, and the accuracy of the predicted flow.

However, no prior work exists on general transfer learning for time-series forecasting. In this paper, motivated by recent success of transfer learning in CNN model and image-related tasks, we for the first time show how time-series representations learned with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) on large-scale datasets can be efficiently transferred to other time-series forecasting tasks with limited amount of training data. We also validate that despite differences in time-series statistics and tasks in the datasets, the transferred representation leads to significantly improved forecasting results outperforming majority of the best time-series methods on the public M3 and other datasets. Our online universal forecasting tool, DeepCast, will leverage transfer learning to provide accurate forecasts for a diverse set of time series where classical methods were computationally infeasible or inapplicable due to short training history.",

Position agnostic and position aware character embeddings are combined to produce an embedding vector for each word. The learned word representations are shown to be very sparse and facilitate improved results on language modeling tasks, despite using markedly fewer parameters, and without the need to apply dropout. A final experiment suggests that weight sharing contributes to sparsity, increases performance, and prevents overfitting.",

    "abstract": "Much recent research has been devoted to video prediction and generation,  but mostly for short-scale time horizons. The hierarchical video prediction method by Villegas et al. (2017) is an example of a state of the art method for long term video prediction.  However, their method has limited applicability in practical settings as it requires a ground truth pose (e.g.,  poses of joints of a human) at training time.   This paper presents a long term hierarchical video prediction model that does not have such a restriction. We show that the network learns its own higher-level structure (e.g., pose equivalent hidden variables) that works better in cases where the ground truth pose does not fully capture all of the information needed to  predict  the  next  frame.   This  method  gives  sharper  results  than  other  video prediction methods which do not require a ground truth pose, and its efficiency is shown on the Humans 3.6M and Robot Pushing datasets.",

This paper introduces ResBinNet, which is a composition of two interlinked methodologies aiming to address the slow convergence speed and limited accuracy of binary convolutional neural networks. The first method, called residual binarization, learns a multi-level binary representation for the features within a certain neural network layer. The second method, called temperature adjustment, gradually binarizes the weights of a particular layer. The two methods jointly learn a set of soft-binarized parameters that improve the convergence rate and accuracy of binary neural networks. We corroborate the applicability and scalability of ResBinNet by implementing a prototype hardware accelerator.

    "abstract": "Neural sequence generation is commonly approached by using maximum- likelihood (ML) estimation or reinforcement learning (RL). However, it is known that they have their own shortcomings; ML presents training/testing discrepancy, whereas RL suffers from sample inefficiency. We point out that it is difficult to resolve all of the shortcomings simultaneously because of a tradeoff between ML and RL. In order to counteract these problems, we propose an objective function for sequence generation using \u03b1-divergence, which leads to an ML-RL integrated method that exploits better parts of ML and RL. We demonstrate that the proposed objective function generalizes ML and RL objective functions because it includes both as its special cases (ML corresponds to \u03b1 \u2192 0 and RL to \u03b1 \u2192 1). We provide a proposition stating that the difference between the RL objective function and the proposed one monotonically decreases with increasing \u03b1. Experimental results on machine translation tasks show that minimizing the proposed objective function achieves better sequence generation performance than ML-based methods.",

    "abstract": "The assumption that data samples are independently identically distributed is the backbone of many learning algorithms. Nevertheless, datasets often exhibit rich structures in practice, and we argue that there exist some unknown orders within the data instances. Aiming to find such orders, we introduce a novel Generative Markov Network (GMN) which we use to extract the order of data instances automatically. Specifically, we assume that the instances are sampled from a Markov chain. Our goal is to learn the transitional operator of the chain as well as the generation order by maximizing the generation probability under all possible data permutations. One of our key ideas is to use neural networks as a soft lookup table for approximating the possibly huge, but discrete transition matrix. This strategy allows us to amortize the space complexity with a single model and make the transitional operator generalizable to unseen instances. To ensure the learned Markov chain is ergodic, we propose a greedy batch-wise permutation scheme that allows fast training.  Empirically, we evaluate the learned Markov chain by showing that GMNs are able to discover orders among data instances and also perform comparably well to state-of-the-art methods on the one-shot recognition benchmark task.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in computing technology and sensor design have made it easier to collect longitudinal or time series data from patients, resulting in a gigantic amount of available medical data. Most of the medical time series lack annotations or even when the annotations are available they could be subjective and prone to human errors. Earlier works have developed natural language processing techniques to extract concept annotations and/or clinical narratives from doctor notes. However, these approaches are slow and do not use the accompanying medical time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the problem of concept annotation for the medical time series data, i.e., the task of predicting and localizing medical concepts by using the time series data as input. We propose Relational Multi-Instance Learning (RMIL) - a deep Multi Instance Learning framework based on recurrent neural networks, which uses pooling functions and attention mechanisms for the concept annotation tasks. Empirical results on medical datasets show that our proposed models outperform various multi-instance learning models.",

In this carefully controlled setting, we are able to describe the specific form of the optimal solution to the minimisation problem of the training step. We show that the autoencoder indeed approximates this solution during training. Secondly, we identify a clear failure in the generalisation capacity of the autoencoder, namely its inability to interpolate data. Finally, we explore several regularisation schemes to resolve the generalisation problem. Given the great attention that has been recently given to the generative capacity of neural networks, we believe that studying in depth simple geometric cases sheds some light on the generation process and can provide a minimal requirement experimental setup for more complex architectures. \n",

We propose the activation function Displaced Rectifier Linear Unit (DReLU) by conjecturing that extending the identity function of ReLU to the third quadrant enhances compatibility with batch normalization. Moreover, we used statistical tests to compare the impact of using distinct activation functions (ReLU, LReLU, PReLU, ELU, and DReLU) on the learning speed and test accuracy performance of standardized VGG and Residual Networks state-of-the-art models. These convolutional neural networks were trained on CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10, the most commonly used deep learning computer vision datasets. The results showed DReLU speeded up learning in all models and datasets. Besides, statistical significant performance assessments (p&lt;0.05) showed DReLU enhanced the test accuracy presented by ReLU in all scenarios. Furthermore, DReLU showed better test accuracy than any other tested activation function in all experiments with one exception, in which case it presented the second best performance. Therefore, this work demonstrates that it is possible to increase performance replacing ReLU by an enhanced activation function.",

We suggest one advantage of this particular type of memory is the ability to easily assign credit to a specific state when remembered information is found to be useful. Inspired by this idea, and the increasing popularity of external memory mechanisms to handle long-term dependencies in deep learning systems, we propose a novel algorithm which uses a reservoir sampling procedure to maintain an external memory consisting of a fixed number of past states. The algorithm allows a deep reinforcement learning agent to learn online to preferentially remember those states which are found to be useful to recall later on. Critically this method allows for efficient online computation of gradient estimates with respect to the write process of the external memory. Thus unlike most prior mechanisms for external memory it is feasible to use in an online reinforcement learning setting.\n",

In other words, most images in the data distribution are both correctly classified by the model and are very close to a visually similar misclassified image. Despite substantial research interest, the cause of the phenomenon is still poorly understood and remains unsolved. We hypothesize that this counter intuitive behavior is a naturally occurring result of the high dimensional geometry of the data manifold. As a first step towards exploring this hypothesis, we study a simple synthetic dataset of classifying between two concentric high dimensional spheres. For this dataset we show a fundamental tradeoff between the amount of test error and the average distance to nearest error. In particular, we prove that any model which misclassifies a small constant fraction of a sphere will be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of size $O(1/\\sqrt{d})$. Surprisingly, when we train several different architectures on this dataset, all of their error sets naturally approach this theoretical bound. As a result of the theory, the vulnerability of neural networks to small adversarial perturbations is a logical consequence of the amount of test error observed. We hope that our theoretical analysis of this very simple case will point the way forward to explore how the geometry of complex real-world data sets leads to adversarial examples.",

It learns to estimate the pose of the agent and\nprogressively construct top-down 2D global maps from egocentric views in a spatially\nextended environment. During the exploration, our proposed ESM network\nmodel updates belief of the global map based on local observations using a recurrent\nneural network. It also augments the local mapping with a novel external\nmemory to encode and store latent representations of the visited places based on\ntheir corresponding locations in the egocentric coordinate. This enables the agents\nto perform loop closure and mapping correction. This work contributes in the\nfollowing aspects: first, our proposed ESM network provides an accurate mapping\nability which is vitally important for embodied agents to navigate to goal locations.\nIn the experiments, we demonstrate the functionalities of the ESM network in\nrandom walks in complicated 3D mazes by comparing with several competitive\nbaselines and state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\nalgorithms. Secondly, we faithfully hypothesize the functionality and the working\nmechanism of navigation cells in the brain. Comprehensive analysis of our model\nsuggests the essential role of individual modules in our proposed architecture and\ndemonstrates efficiency of communications among these modules. We hope this\nwork would advance research in the collaboration and communications over both\nfields of computer science and computational neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "In the adversarial-perturbation problem of neural networks, an adversary starts with a neural network model $F$ and a point $\\bfx$ that $F$ classifies correctly, and applies a \\emph{small perturbation} to  $\\bfx$ to produce another point $\\bfx'$ that $F$ classifies \\emph{incorrectly}.  In this paper, we propose taking into account \\emph{the inherent confidence information} produced by models when studying adversarial perturbations, where a natural measure of ``confidence'' is \\|F(\\bfx)\\|_\\infty$ (i.e. how confident $F$ is about its prediction?). Motivated by a thought experiment based on the manifold assumption, we propose a ``goodness property'' of models which states that \\emph{confident regions of a good model should be well separated}. We give formalizations of this property and examine existing robust training objectives in view of them. Interestingly, we find that a recent objective by Madry et al. encourages training a model that satisfies well our formal version of the goodness property, but has a weak control of points that are wrong but with low confidence. However, if Madry et al.'s model is indeed a good solution to their objective, then good and bad points are now distinguishable and we can try to embed uncertain points back to the closest confident region to get (hopefully) correct predictions. We thus propose embedding objectives and algorithms, and perform an empirical study using this method. Our experimental results are encouraging: Madry et al.'s model wrapped with our embedding procedure achieves almost perfect success rate in defending against attacks that the base model fails on, while retaining good generalization behavior.\n",

Explanation module works by embedding a high-dimensional deep network layer nonlinearly into a low-dimensional explanation space while retaining faithfulness, so that the original deep learning predictions can be constructed from the few concepts extracted by the explanation module. We then visualize such concepts for human to learn about the high-level concepts that deep learning is using to make decisions. We propose an algorithm called Sparse Reconstruction Autoencoder (SRAE) for learning the embedding to the explanation space. SRAE aims to reconstruct part of the original feature space while retaining faithfulness. A visualization system is then introduced for human understanding of features in the explanation space. The proposed method is applied to explain CNN models in image classification tasks, and several novel metrics are introduced to evaluate the performance of explanations quantitatively without human involvement. Experiments show that the proposed approach could generate better explanations of the mechanisms CNN use for making predictions.",

The agent learns policies and value function through trial-and-error interactions with the environment until converging to an optimal policy. Robustness and stability are critical in RL; however, neural network can be vulnerable to noise from unexpected sources and is not likely to withstand very slight disturbances. We note that agents generated from mild environment using A3C are not able to handle challenging environments. Learning from adversarial examples, we proposed an algorithm called Adversary Robust A3C (AR-A3C) to improve the agent\u2019s performance under noisy environments. In this algorithm, an adversarial agent is introduced to the learning process to make it more robust against adversarial disturbances, thereby making it more adaptive to noisy environments.

In the variational E-step,\nthe latent states are then  \noptimized according to a tractable free-energy objective. Given a data point, we can show that evolutionary algorithms can be used for the variational optimization loop by (A)~considering the bit-vectors of the latent states as genomes of individuals, and by (B)~defining the fitness of the\nindividuals as the (log) joint probabilities given by the used generative model.\n\nAs a proof of concept, we apply the novel evolutionary EM approach to the optimization of the parameters of noisy-OR Bayes nets and binary sparse coding on artificial and real data (natural image patches). Using point mutations and single-point cross-over for the evolutionary algorithm, we find that scalable variational EM algorithms are obtained which efficiently improve the data likelihood. In general we believe that, with the link established here, standard as well as recent results in the field of evolutionary optimization can be leveraged to address the difficult problem of parameter optimization in generative models.",

However, techniques for representing graphs as real-valued vectors are still in their infancy. Recent works have proposed several approaches (e.g., graph convolutional networks), but as we show in this paper, these methods have difficulty generalizing to large graphs. In this paper we propose Graph2Seq, an embedding framework that represents graphs as an infinite time-series. By not limiting the representation to a fixed dimension, Graph2Seq naturally scales to graphs of arbitrary size. Moreover, through analysis of a formal computational model we show that an unbounded sequence is necessary for scalability. Graph2Seq is also reversible, allowing full recovery of the graph structure from the sequence. Experimental evaluations of Graph2Seq on a variety of combinatorial optimization problems show strong generalization and strict improvement over state of the art. ",

On one hand, traditional word embeddings are trained on a large scale corpus for general-purpose tasks, which are often sub-optimal for many domain-specific tasks. On the other hand, many domain-specific tasks do not have a large enough domain corpus to obtain high-quality embeddings. We observe that domains are not isolated and a small domain corpus can leverage the learned knowledge from many past domains to augment that corpus in order to generate high-quality embeddings. In this paper, we formulate the learning of word embeddings as a lifelong learning process. Given knowledge learned from many previous domains and a small new domain corpus, the proposed method can effectively generate new domain embeddings by leveraging a simple but effective algorithm and a meta-learner, where the meta-learner is able to provide word context similarity information at the domain-level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively learn new domain embeddings from a small corpus and past domain knowledges\\footnote{We will release the code after final revisions.}.

Our method treats all training features from a deep neural network as radial basis function centres and computes loss by summing the influence of a feature's nearby centres in the embedding space. Having a radial basis function centred on each training feature is made scalable by treating it as an approximate nearest neighbour search problem. End-to-end learning of the network and solver is carried out, mapping high dimensional features into clusters of the same class. This results in a well formed embedding space, where semantically related instances are likely to be located near one another, regardless of whether or not the network was trained on those classes. The same loss function is used for both the metric learning and classification problems. We show that our radial basis function solver outperforms state-of-the-art embedding approaches on the Stanford Cars196 and CUB-200-2011 datasets.

This leads to the nonidentifiability of the event times\u2019 distribution parameters, which makes the problem significantly more challenging. In this work we introduce Siamese Survival Prognosis Network, a novel Siamese Deep Neural Network architecture that is able to effectively learn from data in the presence of multiple adverse events. The Siamese Survival Network is especially crafted to issue pairwise concordant time-dependent risks, in which longer event times are assigned lower risks. Furthermore, our architecture is able to directly optimize an approximation to the C-discrimination index, rather than relying on well-known metrics of cross-entropy etc., and which are not able to capture the unique requirements of survival analysis with competing risks.

    "abstract": "We propose a \"Learning to Select\" problem that selects the best among the flexible size candidates. This makes decisions based not only on the properties of the candidate, but also on the environment in which they belong to. For example, job dispatching in the manufacturing factory is a typical \"Learning to Select\" problem. We propose Variable-Length CNN which combines the classification power using hidden features from CNN and the idea of flexible input from Learning to Rank algorithms. This not only can handles flexible candidates using Dynamic Computation Graph, but also is computationally efficient because it only builds a network with the necessary sizes to fit the situation. We applied the algorithm to the job dispatching problem which uses the dispatching log data obtained from the virtual fine-tuned factory. Our proposed algorithm shows considerably better performance than other comparable algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We hypothesize that end-to-end neural image captioning systems work seemingly well because they exploit and learn \u2018distributional similarity\u2019 in a multimodal feature space, by mapping a test image to similar training images in this space and generating a caption from the same space. To validate our hypothesis, we focus on the \u2018image\u2019 side of image captioning, and vary the input image representation but keep the RNN text generation model of a CNN-RNN constant. We propose a sparse bag-of-objects vector as an interpretable representation to investigate our distributional similarity hypothesis. We found that image captioning models (i) are capable of separating structure from noisy input representations; (ii) experience virtually no significant performance loss when a high dimensional representation is compressed to a lower dimensional space; (iii) cluster images with similar visual and linguistic information together; (iv) are heavily reliant on test sets with a similar distribution as the training set; (v) repeatedly generate the same captions by matching images and \u2018retrieving\u2019 a caption in the joint visual-textual space. Our experiments all point to one fact: that our distributional similarity hypothesis holds. We conclude that, regardless of the image representation, image captioning systems seem to match images and generate captions in a learned joint image-text semantic subspace.\n",

ISRLU has better performance than ELU but has many of the same benefits. ISRLU and ELU have similar curves and characteristics. Both have negative values, allowing them to push mean unit activation closer to zero, and bring the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient, ensuring a noise- robust deactivation state, lessening the over fitting risk. The significant performance advantage of ISRLU on traditional CPUs also carry over to more efficient HW implementations on HW/SW codesign for CNNs/RNNs. In experiments with TensorFlow, ISRLU leads to faster learning and better generalization than ReLU on CNNs. This work also suggests a computationally efficient variant called the \u201cinverse square root unit\u201d (ISRU) which can be used for RNNs. Many RNNs use either long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent units (GRU) which are implemented with tanh and sigmoid activation functions.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection discovers regular patterns in unlabeled data and identifies the non-conforming data points, which in some cases are the result of malicious attacks by adversaries. Learners such as One-Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVMs) have been successfully in anomaly detection, yet their performance may degrade significantly in the presence of sophisticated adversaries, who target the algorithm itself by compromising the integrity of the training data. With the rise in the use of machine learning in mission critical day-to-day activities where errors may have significant consequences, it is imperative that machine learning systems are made secure. To address this, we propose a defense mechanism that is based on a contraction of the data, and we test its effectiveness using OCSVMs. The proposed approach introduces a layer of uncertainty on top of the OCSVM learner, making it infeasible for the adversary to guess the specific configuration of the learner. We theoretically analyze the effects of adversarial perturbations on the separating margin of OCSVMs and provide empirical evidence on several benchmark datasets, which show that by carefully contracting the data in low dimensional spaces, we can successfully identify adversarial samples that would not have been identifiable in the original dimensional space. The numerical results show that the proposed method improves OCSVMs performance significantly (2-7%)",

Endowing reinforcement learning agents with episodic memory is a key step on the path toward replicating human-like general intelligence. We analyze why standard RL agents lack episodic memory today, and why existing RL tasks don't require it. We design a new form of external memory called Masked Experience Memory, or MEM, modeled after key features of human episodic memory. To evaluate episodic memory we define an RL task based on the common children's game of Concentration.

    "abstract": "We investigate the methods by which a Reservoir Computing Network (RCN) learns concepts such as 'similar' and 'different' between pairs of images using a small training dataset and generalizes these concepts to previously unseen types of data. Specifically, we show that an RCN trained to identify relationships between image-pairs drawn from a subset of digits from the MNIST database or the depth maps of subset of visual scenes from a moving camera generalizes the learned transformations to images of digits unseen during training or depth maps of different visual scenes. We infer, using Principal Component Analysis, that the high dimensional reservoir states generated from an input image pair with a specific transformation converge over time to a unique relationship. Thus, as opposed to training the entire high dimensional reservoir state, the reservoir only needs to train on these unique relationships, allowing the reservoir to perform well with very few training examples. Thus, generalization of learning to unseen images is interpretable in terms of clustering of the reservoir state onto the attractor corresponding to the transformation in reservoir space. We find that RCNs can identify and generalize linear and non-linear transformations, and combinations of transformations, naturally and be a robust and effective image classifier. Additionally, RCNs perform significantly better than state of the art neural network classification techniques such as deep Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) in generalization tasks both on the MNIST dataset and more complex depth maps of visual scenes from a moving camera. This work helps bridge the gap between explainable machine learning and biological learning through analogies using small datasets, and points to new directions in the investigation of learning processes.",

Most methods rely on defining a pipeline of deriving features via generative modeling and then applying clustering algorithms, separating the modeling and discriminative processes. We propose a deep hierarchical generative model which uses a mixture of discrete and continuous distributions to learn to effectively separate the different data manifolds and is trainable end-to-end. We show that by specifying the form of the discrete variable distribution we are imposing a specific structure on the model's latent representations.

Here, we use a variational autoencoder with an autoregressive decoder to learn a latent face space from a uniquely diverse dataset of portraits that control much of the variation irrelevant to human identity and appearance. Our method generates photorealistic portraits of fictive identities with a smooth, navigable latent space. We validate our model's alignment with human sensitivities by introducing a psychophysical Turing test for images, which humans mostly fail, a rare occurrence with any interesting generative image model.

    "abstract": " Reinforcement learning methods have recently achieved impressive results on a wide range of control problems. However, especially with complex inputs, they still require an extensive amount of training data in order to converge to a meaningful solution. This limitation largely prohibits  their usage for complex input spaces such as video signals, and it is still impossible to use it for a number of complex problems in a real world environments, including many of those for video based control. Supervised learning, on the contrary, is capable of learning on a relatively small number of samples, however it does not take into account reward-based control policies and is not capable to provide independent control policies.  In this article we propose a model-free control method, which uses a combination of reinforcement and supervised learning for autonomous control and paves the way towards policy based control in real world environments. We use SpeedDreams/TORCS video game to demonstrate that our approach requires much less samples (hundreds of thousands against millions or tens of millions) comparing to the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques on similar data, and at the same time overcomes both supervised and reinforcement learning approaches in terms of quality. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of the method to MuJoCo control problems. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we find that by designing a novel loss function entitled, ''tracking loss'', Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based object detectors can be successfully converted to well-performed visual trackers without any extra computational cost. This property is preferable to visual tracking where annotated video sequences for training are always absent, because rich features learned by detectors from still images could be utilized by dynamic trackers. It also avoids extra machinery such as feature engineering and feature aggregation proposed in previous studies. Tracking loss achieves this property by exploiting the internal structure of feature maps within the detection network and treating different feature points discriminatively. Such structure allows us to simultaneously consider discrimination quality and bounding box accuracy which is found to be crucial to the success. We also propose a network compression method to accelerate tracking speed without performance reduction. That also verifies tracking loss will remain highly effective even if the network is drastically compressed. Furthermore, if we employ a carefully designed tracking loss ensemble, the tracker would be much more robust and accurate. Evaluation results show that our trackers (including the ensemble tracker and two baseline trackers), outperform all state-of-the-art methods on VOT 2016 Challenge in terms of Expected Average Overlap (EAO) and robustness.

This step makes sure that the embedding, or representation, of the data is used in the best possible way for the considered task. This idea is then tested on multiple architectures with various data sets, showing that it consistently provides a boost in performance.",

    "abstract": "As deep learning-based classifiers are increasingly adopted in real-world applications, the importance of understanding how a particular label is chosen grows. Single decision trees are an example of a simple, interpretable classifier, but are unsuitable for use with complex, high-dimensional data. On the other hand, the variational autoencoder (VAE) is designed to learn a factored, low-dimensional representation of data, but typically encodes high-likelihood data in an intrinsically non-separable way.  We introduce the differentiable decision tree (DDT) as a modular component of deep networks and a simple, differentiable loss function that allows for end-to-end optimization of a deep network to compress high-dimensional data for classification by a single decision tree.  We also explore the power of labeled data in a  supervised VAE (SVAE) with a Gaussian mixture prior, which leverages label information to produce a high-quality generative model with improved bounds on log-likelihood.  We combine the SVAE with the DDT to get our classifier+VAE (C+VAE), which is competitive in both classification error and log-likelihood, despite optimizing both simultaneously and using a very simple encoder/decoder architecture.

    "abstract": "In representation learning (RL), how to make the learned representations easy to interpret and less overfitted to training data are two important but challenging issues. To address these problems, we study a new type of regularization approach that encourages the supports of weight vectors in RL models to have small overlap, by simultaneously promoting near-orthogonality among vectors and sparsity of each vector. We apply the proposed regularizer to two models: neural networks (NNs) and sparse coding (SC), and develop an efficient ADMM-based algorithm for regularized SC. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that weight vectors learned under our regularizer are more interpretable and have better generalization performance.",

Here, \nwe propose a novel algorithm, Deep Temporal Clustering (DTC), a fully unsupervised method, to naturally integrate dimensionality reduction and temporal clustering into a single end to end learning framework. The algorithm starts with an initial cluster estimates using an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a novel temporal clustering layer for cluster assignment. Then it jointly optimizes the clustering objective and the dimensionality reduction objective. Based on requirement and application, the temporal clustering layer can be customized with any temporal similarity metric. Several similarity metrics are considered and compared.  To gain insight into features that the network has learned for its clustering, we apply a visualization method that generates a heat map of regions of interest in the timeseries. The viability of the algorithm is demonstrated using timeseries data from diverse domains, ranging from earthquakes to sensor data from spacecraft. In each case, we show that our algorithm outperforms traditional methods. This performance is attributed to fully integrated temporal dimensionality reduction and clustering criterion.",

    "abstract": "A bottleneck problem in machine learning-based relationship extraction (RE) algorithms, and particularly of deep learning-based ones, is the availability of training data in the form of annotated corpora. For specific domains, such as biomedicine, the long time and high expertise required for the development of manually annotated corpora explain that most of the existing one are relatively small (i.e., hundreds of sentences). Beside, larger corpora focusing on general or domain-specific relationships (such as citizenship or drug-drug interactions) have been developed. In this paper, we study how large annotated corpora developed for alternative tasks may improve the performances on biomedicine related tasks, for which few annotated resources are available. We experiment two deep learning-based models to extract relationships from biomedical texts with high performance. The first one combine locally extracted features using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, while the second exploit the syntactic structure of sentences using a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) architecture. Our experiments show that, contrary to the former, the latter benefits from a cross-corpus learning strategy to improve the performance of relationship extraction tasks. Indeed our approach leads to the best published performances for two biomedical RE tasks, and to state-of-the-art results for two other biomedical RE tasks, for which few annotated resources are available (less than 400 manually annotated sentences). This may be particularly impactful in specialized domains in which training resources are scarce, because they would benefit from the training data of other domains for which large annotated corpora does exist.

Introducing a new concept called Representation Dictionary Duality, we show that CNN elements (filters) are trained to be representation vectors and then, during reconstruction, used as dictionaries.

The optimal state trajectories are used to learn a generative or predictive model of the \u201cgood\u201d states distribution. The reward signal is computed by a function of the difference between the actual next state acquired by the agent and the predicted next state given by the learned generative or predictive model. With this inferred reward function, we perform standard reinforcement learning in the inner loop to guide the agent to learn the given task. Experimental evaluations across a range of tasks demonstrate that the proposed method produces superior performance compared to standard reinforcement learning with both complete or sparse hand engineered rewards. Furthermore, we show that our method successfully enables an agent to learn good actions directly from expert player video of games such as the Super Mario Bros and Flappy Bird.",

We analyze the convergence of GAN training from this new point of view to understand why mode collapse happens. We hypothesize the existence of undesirable local equilibria in this non-convex game to be responsible for mode collapse. We observe that these local equilibria often exhibit sharp gradients of the discriminator function around some real data points. We demonstrate that these degenerate local equilibria can be avoided with a gradient penalty scheme called DRAGAN. We show that DRAGAN enables faster training, achieves improved stability with fewer mode collapses, and leads to generator networks with better modeling performance across a variety of architectures and objective functions.",

    "abstract": "During the last years, a remarkable breakthrough has been made in AI domain\nthanks to artificial deep neural networks that achieved a great success in many\nmachine learning tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, speech\nrecognition, malware detection and so on. However, they are highly vulnerable\nto easily crafted adversarial examples. Many investigations have pointed out this\nfact and different approaches have been proposed to generate attacks while adding\na limited perturbation to the original data. The most robust known method so far\nis the so called C&amp;W attack [1]. Nonetheless, a countermeasure known as fea-\nture squeezing coupled with ensemble defense showed that most of these attacks\ncan be destroyed [6]. In this paper, we present a new method we call Centered\nInitial Attack (CIA) whose advantage is twofold : first, it insures by construc-\ntion the maximum perturbation to be smaller than a threshold fixed beforehand,\nwithout the clipping process that degrades the quality of attacks. Second, it is\nrobust against recently introduced defenses such as feature squeezing, JPEG en-\ncoding and even against a voting ensemble of defenses. While its application is\nnot limited to images, we illustrate this using five of the current best classifiers\non ImageNet dataset among which two are adversarialy retrained on purpose to\nbe robust against attacks. With a fixed maximum perturbation of only 1.5% on\nany pixel, around 80% of attacks (targeted) fool the voting ensemble defense and\nnearly 100% when the perturbation is only 6%. While this shows how it is difficult\nto defend against CIA attacks, the last section of the paper gives some guidelines\nto limit their impact.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new model for document embedding. Existing approaches either require complex inference or use recurrent neural networks that are difficult to parallelize. We take a different route and use recent advances in language modeling to develop a convolutional neural network embedding model. This allows us to train deeper architectures that are fully parallelizable. Stacking layers together increases the receptive filed allowing each successive layer to model increasingly longer range semantic dependences within the document. Empirically we demonstrate superior results on two publicly available benchmarks. Full code will be released with the final version of this paper.",

The  state-of-the art CNN machines such as image rest net \\cite{He_2016_CVPR} are described by real value inputs and kernel convolutions followed by the local and  non-linear rectified linear outputs.  Understanding the role of these layers, the accuracy and limitations of them,  as well as making them more efficient (fewer parameters)  are all ongoing research questions. \n \n Inspired in quantum theory, we propose the use of complex value kernel functions, followed by the local non-linear  absolute (modulus) operator square. We argue that an advantage of quantum inspired complex kernels is robustness to realistic unpredictable scenarios (such as clutter noise,  data deformations). We study a concrete problem of shape detection and show that when multiple overlapping shapes are deformed and/or clutter noise is added, a convolution layer with quantum inspired complex kernels outperforms the statistical/classical kernel counterpart and a \"Bayesian shape estimator\" . The superior performance is due to the quantum phenomena of interference, not present in classical CNNs.  ",

    "abstract": "Working memory requires information about external stimuli to be represented in the brain even after those stimuli go away. This information is encoded in the activities of neurons, and neural activities change over timescales of tens of milliseconds. Information in working memory, however, is retained for tens of seconds, suggesting the question of how time-varying neural activities maintain stable representations. Prior work shows that, if the neural dynamics are in the `  null space' of the representation - so that changes to neural activity do not affect the downstream read-out of stimulus information - then information can be retained for periods much longer than the time-scale of individual-neuronal activities. The prior work, however, requires precisely constructed synaptic connectivity matrices, without explaining how this would arise in a biological neural network. To identify mechanisms through which biological networks can self-organize to learn  memory function, we derived biologically plausible synaptic plasticity rules that dynamically modify the connectivity matrix to enable information storing. Networks implementing this plasticity rule can successfully learn to form memory representations even if only 10% of the synapses are plastic, they are robust to synaptic noise, and they can represent information about multiple stimuli.

    "abstract": "Despite neural network\u2019s high performance, the lack of interpretability has been the main bottleneck for its safe usage in practice. In domains with high stakes (e.g., medical diagnosis), gaining insights into the network is critical for gaining trust and being adopted. One of the ways to improve interpretability of a NN is to explain the importance of a particular concept (e.g., gender) in prediction. This is useful for explaining reasoning behind the networks\u2019 predictions, and for revealing any biases the network may have. This work aims to provide quantitative answers to \\textit{the relative importance of concepts of interest} via concept activation vectors (CAV). In particular, this framework enables non-machine learning experts to express concepts of interests and  test hypotheses using examples (e.g., a set of pictures that illustrate  the concept). We show that CAV can be learned given a relatively small set of examples. Testing with CAV, for example, can answer whether a particular concept (e.g., gender) is more important in predicting a given class (e.g., doctor) than other set of concepts. Interpreting with CAV does not require any retraining or modification of the network. We show that many levels of meaningful concepts are learned (e.g., color, texture, objects, a person\u2019s occupation), and we present CAV\u2019s \\textit{empirical deepdream} \u2014 where we maximize an activation using a set of example pictures. We show how various insights can be gained from the relative importance testing with CAV.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a potential solution for model compression. The idea is to make a small student network imitate the target of a large teacher network, then the student network can be competitive to the teacher one. Most previous studies focus on model distillation in the classification task, where they propose different architectures and initializations for the student network. However, only the classification task is not enough, and other related tasks such as regression and retrieval are barely considered. To solve the problem, in this paper, we take face recognition as a breaking point and propose model distillation with knowledge transfer from face classification to alignment and verification. By selecting appropriate initializations and targets in the knowledge transfer, the distillation can be easier in non-classification tasks. Experiments on the CelebA and CASIA-WebFace datasets demonstrate that the student network can be competitive to the teacher one in alignment and verification, and even surpasses the teacher network under specific compression rates. In addition, to achieve stronger knowledge transfer, we also use a common initialization trick to improve the distillation performance of classification. Evaluations on the CASIA-Webface and large-scale MS-Celeb-1M datasets show the effectiveness of this simple trick.",

The network can be used in the reverse direction to generate data that closely resembles the input by feeding in representation vectors as required. This research paper also explores the use of mathematical abs (absolute valued) functions as activation functions which constitutes the core part of this neural network architecture.

    "abstract": "Based on our observation that there exists a dramatic drop for the singular values of the fully connected layers or a single feature map of the convolutional layer, and that the dimension of the concatenated feature vector almost equals the summation of the dimension on each feature map, we propose a singular value decomposition (SVD) based approach to estimate the dimension of the deep manifolds for a typical convolutional neural network VGG19. We choose three categories from the ImageNet, namely Persian Cat, Container Ship and Volcano, and determine the local dimension of the deep manifolds of the deep layers through the tangent space of a target image. Through several augmentation methods, we found that the Gaussian noise method is closer to the intrinsic dimension, as by adding random noise to an image we are moving in an arbitrary dimension, and when the rank of the feature matrix of the augmented images does not increase we are very close\nto the local dimension of the manifold. We also estimate the dimension of the deep manifold based on the tangent space for each of the maxpooling layers. Our results show that the dimensions of different categories are close to each other and decline quickly along the convolutional layers and fully connected layers. Furthermore, we show that the dimensions decline quickly inside the Conv5 layer. Our work provides new insights for the intrinsic structure of deep neural networks and helps unveiling the inner organization of the black box of deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "The key idea of variational auto-encoders (VAEs) resembles that of traditional auto-encoder models in which spatial information is supposed to be explicitly encoded in the latent space. However, the latent variables in VAEs are vectors, which can be interpreted as multiple feature maps of size 1x1. Such representations can only convey spatial information implicitly when coupled with powerful decoders. In this work, we propose spatial VAEs that use feature maps of larger size as latent variables to explicitly capture spatial information. This is achieved by allowing the latent variables to be sampled from matrix-variate normal (MVN) distributions whose parameters are computed from the encoder network. To increase dependencies among locations on latent feature maps and reduce the number of parameters, we further propose spatial VAEs via low-rank MVN distributions. Experimental results show that the proposed spatial VAEs outperform original VAEs in capturing rich structural and spatial information.",

Autostacker improves the prediction accuracy of machine learning baselines by utilizing an innovative hierarchical stacking architecture and an efficient parameter search algorithm.

By parallelizing PHC, Autostacker can provide candidate pipelines with sufficient prediction accuracy within a short amount of time. These pipelines can be used as is or as a starting point for human experts to build on. By focusing on the modelling process, Autostacker breaks the tradition of following fixed order pipelines by exploring not only single model pipeline but also innovative combinations and structures. As we will show in the experiment section, Autostacker achieves significantly better performance both in terms of test accuracy and time cost comparing with human initial trials and recent popular AutoML system.",

To do so, the embedding normalizes features in the context of the problem, and discretizes their values to reduce noise and regularize the embedding space. Significantly, this also reduces the computational cost of processing the resultant representations. The proposed method is shown to outperform single layer embeddings on several image classification tasks, while also being more robust to the choice of the pre-trained model used for obtaining the initial features. The performance gap in classification accuracy between thoroughly tuned solutions and the full-network embedding is also reduced, which makes of the proposed approach a competitive solution for a large set of applications.",

We learn the model using spectral learning and show how to extract the parameters using only three passes through the training dataset.

    "abstract": "We present a novel regularization strategy for training neural networks which we call ``BitNet''. The parameters of neural networks are usually unconstrained and have a dynamic range dispersed over a real valued range. Our key idea is to control the expressive power of the network by dynamically quantizing the range and set of values that the parameters can take. We formulate this idea using a novel end-to-end approach  that regularizes a typical classification loss function. Our regularizer is inspired by the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. For each layer of the network, our approach optimizes a translation and scaling factor along with integer-valued parameters. We empirically compare BitNet to an equivalent unregularized model on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. We show that BitNet converges faster to a superior quality solution. Additionally, the resulting model is significantly smaller in size due to the use of integer instead of floating-point parameters.",

The hierarchical architecture consisting of multiple GANs preserves both local and global topological features, and automatically partitions the input graph into representative stages for feature learning. The stages facilitate reconstruction and can be used as indicators of the importance of the associated topological structures. Experiments show that our method produces subgraphs retaining a wide range of topological features, even in early reconstruction stages.

    "abstract": "Estimating the location where an image was taken based solely on the contents of the image is a challenging task, even for humans, as properly labeling an image in such a fashion relies heavily on contextual information, and is not as simple as identifying  a single object in the image. Thus any methods which attempt to do so must somehow account for these complexities, and no single model to date is completely capable of addressing all challenges. This work contributes to the state of research in image geolocation inferencing by introducing a novel global meshing strategy, outlining a variety of training procedures to overcome the considerable data limitations when training these models, and demonstrating how incorporating additional information can be used to improve the overall performance of a geolocation inference model. In this work, it is shown that Delaunay triangles are an effective type of mesh for geolocation in relatively low volume scenarios when compared to results from state of the art models which use quad trees and an order of magnitude more training data.  In addition, the time of posting, learned user albuming, and other meta data are easily incorporated to improve geolocation by up to 11% for country-level (750 km) locality accuracy to 3% for city-level (25 km) localities.\n",

    "abstract": "In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), how to design a suitable reward signal to accelerate learning and stabilize convergence is a critical problem. The global reward signal assigns the same global reward to all agents without distinguishing their contributions, while the local reward signal provides different local rewards to each agent based solely on individual behavior. Both of the two reward assignment approaches have some shortcomings: the former might encourage lazy agents, while the latter might produce selfish agents.\n\nIn this paper, we study reward design problem in cooperative MARL based on packet routing environments. Firstly, we show that the above two reward signals are prone to produce suboptimal policies. Then, inspired by some observations and considerations, we design some mixed reward signals, which are off-the-shelf to learn better policies. Finally, we turn the mixed reward signals into the adaptive counterparts, which achieve best results in our experiments. Other reward signals are also discussed in this paper. As reward design is a very fundamental problem in RL and especially in MARL, we hope that MARL researchers can rethink the rewards used in their systems.",

    "abstract": "According to parallel distributed processing (PDP) theory in psychology, neural networks (NN) learn distributed rather than interpretable localist representations. This view has been held so strongly that few researchers have analysed single units to determine if this assumption is correct. However, recent results from psychology, neuroscience and computer science have shown the occasional existence of local codes emerging in artificial and biological neural networks. In this paper, we undertake the first systematic survey of when local codes emerge in a feed-forward neural network, using generated input and output data with known qualities. We find that the number of local codes that emerge from a NN follows a well-defined distribution across the number of hidden layer neurons, with a peak determined by the size of input data, number of examples presented and the sparsity of input data. Using a 1-hot output code drastically decreases the number of local codes on the hidden layer. The number of emergent local codes increases with the percentage of dropout applied to the hidden layer, suggesting that the localist encoding may offer a resilience to noisy networks. This data suggests that localist coding can emerge from feed-forward PDP networks and suggests some of the conditions that may lead to interpretable localist representations in the cortex. The findings highlight how local codes should not be dismissed out of hand.",

    "abstract": "Training methods for deep networks are primarily variants on stochastic gradient descent.  Techniques that use (approximate) second-order information are rarely used because of the computational cost and noise associated with those approaches in deep learning contexts.  However, in this paper, we show how feedforward deep networks exhibit a low-rank derivative structure.  This low-rank structure makes it possible to use second-order information without needing approximations and without incurring a significantly greater computational cost than gradient descent.  To demonstrate this capability, we implement Cubic Regularization (CR) on a feedforward deep network with stochastic gradient descent and two of its variants.  There, we use CR to calculate learning rates on a per-iteration basis while training on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.  CR proved particularly successful in escaping plateau regions of the objective function.  We also found that this approach requires less problem-specific information (e.g. an optimal initial learning rate) than other first-order methods in order to perform well.",

After suggesting algebraic topology as a measure for data complexity, we show that the power of a network to express the topological complexity of a dataset in its decision boundary is a strictly limiting factor in its ability to generalize. We then provide the first empirical characterization of the topological capacity of neural networks. Our empirical analysis shows that at every level of dataset complexity, neural networks exhibit topological phase transitions and stratification.

To address this, we develop feature-matching autoencoders (FMAEs). FMAEs ensure that the marginal distribution of feature layers are preserved across forward and inverse mappings between domains. We show that FMAEs achieve state of the art for data efficiency and alignment across three tasks: text decipherment, sentiment transfer, and neural machine translation for English-to-German and English-to-French. Most compellingly, FMAEs achieve state of the art for neural translation with limited supervision, with significant BLEU score differences of up to 5.7 and 6.3 over traditional supervised models. Furthermore, on English-to-German, they outperform last year's best fully supervised models such as ByteNet (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016) while using only half as many supervised examples.",

We also reach the closed-form tensor that is implicitly approximated by popular neural KB approaches, revealing the underlying connection between neural and tensor based KB embedding models. Grounded in the theoretical results, we further present a tensor decomposition based framework KBTD to directly approximate the derived closed form tensor. Under this framework, the neural KB embedding models, such as NTN, TransE, Bilinear, and DISTMULT, are unified into a general tensor optimization architecture.

    "abstract": "We design a new policy, called a nearest neighbor policy, that does not require any optimization for simple, low-dimensional continuous control tasks. As this policy does not require any optimization, it allows us to investigate the underlying difficulty of a task without being distracted by optimization difficulty of a learning algorithm. We propose two variants, one that retrieves an entire trajectory based on a pair of initial and goal states, and the other retrieving a partial trajectory based on a pair of current and goal states. We test the proposed policies on five widely-used benchmark continuous control tasks with a sparse reward: Reacher, Half Cheetah, Double Pendulum, Cart Pole and Mountain Car. We observe that the majority (the first four) of these tasks, which have been considered difficult, are easily solved by the proposed policies with high success rates, indicating that reported difficulties of them may have likely been due to the optimization difficulty. Our work suggests that it is necessary to evaluate any sophisticated policy learning algorithm on more challenging problems in order to truly assess the advances from them.",

    "abstract": "Social dilemmas are situations where individuals face a temptation to increase their payoffs at a cost to total welfare. Building artificially intelligent agents that achieve good outcomes in these situations is important because many real world interactions include a tension between selfish interests and the welfare of others. We show how to modify modern reinforcement learning methods to construct agents that act in ways that are simple to understand, nice (begin by cooperating), provokable (try to avoid being exploited), and forgiving (try to return to mutual cooperation). We show both theoretically and experimentally that such agents can maintain cooperation in Markov social dilemmas. Our construction does not require training methods beyond a modification of self-play, thus if an environment is such that good strategies can be constructed in the zero-sum case (eg. Atari) then we can construct agents that solve social dilemmas in this environment. ",

    "abstract": "Bayesian posterior inference is prevalent in various machine learning problems. Variational inference provides one way to approximate the posterior distribution, however its expressive power is limited and so is the accuracy of resulting approximation. Recently, there has a trend of using neural networks to approximate the variational posterior distribution due to the flexibility of neural network architecture. One way to construct flexible variational distribution is to warp a simple density into a complex by normalizing flows, where the resulting density can be analytically evaluated. However, there is a trade-off between the flexibility of normalizing flow and computation cost for efficient transformation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective architecture of normalizing flows, ConvFlow, based on convolution over the dimensions of random input vector. Experiments on synthetic and real world posterior inference problems demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to interpret a well-trained classification model through systematically investigating effects of its hidden units on prediction making. We search for the core hidden units responsible for predicting inputs as the class of interest under the generative Bayesian inference framework. We model such a process of unit selection as an Indian Buffet Process, and derive a simplified objective function via the MAP asymptotic technique. The induced binary optimization problem is efficiently solved with a continuous relaxation method by attaching a Switch Gate layer to the hidden layers of interest. The resulted interpreter model is thus end-to-end optimized via standard gradient back-propagation. Experiments are conducted with two popular deep convolutional classifiers, respectively well-trained on the MNIST dataset and the CI- FAR10 dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed interpreter successfully finds the core hidden units most responsible for prediction making. The modified model, only with the selected units activated, can hold correct predictions at a high rate. Besides, this interpreter model is also able to extract the most informative pixels in the images by connecting a Switch Gate layer to the input layer.\n",

    "abstract": "Style transfer usually refers to the task of applying color and texture information from a specific style image to a given content image while preserving the structure of the latter. Here we tackle the more generic problem of semantic style transfer: given two unpaired collections of images, we aim to learn a mapping between the corpus-level style of each collection, while preserving semantic content shared across the two domains. We introduce XGAN (\"Cross-GAN\"), a dual adversarial autoencoder, which captures a shared representation of the common domain semantic content in an unsupervised way, while jointly learning the domain-to-domain image translations in both directions.  We exploit ideas from the domain adaptation literature and define a semantic consistency loss which encourages the model to preserve semantics in the learned embedding space. We report promising qualitative results for the task of face-to-cartoon translation. The cartoon dataset we collected for this purpose will also be released as a new benchmark for semantic style transfer.",

    "abstract": "Classification and clustering have been studied separately in machine learning and computer vision. Inspired by the recent success of deep learning models in solving various vision problems (e.g., object recognition, semantic segmentation) and the fact that humans serve as the gold standard in assessing clustering algorithms, here, we advocate for a unified treatment of the two problems and suggest that hierarchical frameworks that progressively build complex patterns on top of the simpler ones (e.g., convolutional neural networks) offer a promising solution. We do not dwell much on the learning mechanisms in these frameworks as they are still a matter of debate, with respect to biological constraints. Instead, we emphasize on the compositionality of the real world structures and objects. In particular, we show that CNNs, trained end to end using back propagation with noisy labels, are able to cluster data points belonging to several overlapping shapes, and do so much better than the state of the art algorithms. The main takeaway lesson from our study is that mechanisms of human vision, particularly the hierarchal organization of the visual ventral stream should be taken into account in clustering algorithms (e.g., for learning representations in an unsupervised manner or with minimum supervision) to reach human level clustering performance. This, by no means, suggests that other methods do not hold merits. For example, methods relying on pairwise affinities (e.g., spectral clustering) have been very successful in many cases but still fail in some cases (e.g., overlapping clusters).",

Recent works on generative models, especially on generative adversarial networks, produce nice samples of varied categories of images. But the validation of their quality is highly dependent on the method used. A good generator should generate data which contain meaningful and varied information and that fit the distribution of a dataset. This paper presents a new method to assess a generator. Our approach is based on training a classifier with a mixture of real and generated samples. We train a generative model over a labeled training set, then we use this generative model to sample new data points that we mix with the original training data. This mixture of real and generated data is thus used to train a classifier which is afterwards tested on a given labeled test dataset. We compare this result with the score of the same classifier trained on the real training data mixed with noise. By computing the classifier's accuracy with different ratios of samples from both distributions (real and generated) we are able to estimate if the generator successfully fits and is able to generalize the distribution of the dataset. Our experiments compare the result of different generators from the VAE and GAN framework on MNIST and fashion MNIST dataset.",

In particular, since neural language models may deal with up to millions of classes, their self-normalization properties received notable attention. Several\nrecent studies empirically found that language models, trained using Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE), exhibit self-normalization, but could not explain why. In this study, we provide a theoretical justification to this property by viewing\nNCE as a low-rank matrix approximation. Our empirical investigation compares NCE to the alternative explicit approach for self-normalizing language models. It also uncovers a surprising negative correlation between self-normalization and\nperplexity, as well as some regularity in the observed errors that may potentially be used for improving self-normalization algorithms in the future.",

Hence, there is a need for methods to model and extract richer transformations that capture much higher-level invariances. To that end, we introduce a tool allowing to parametrize the set of filters of a trained convolutional neural network with the latent space of a generative adversarial network. We then show that the method can capture highly non-linear invariances of the data by visualizing their effect in the data space.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the Associative Conversation Model that generates visual information from textual information and uses it for generating sentences in order to utilize visual information in a dialogue system without image input. In research on Neural Machine Translation, there are studies that generate translated sentences using both images and sentences, and these studies show that visual information improves translation performance. However, it is not possible to use sentence generation algorithms using images for the dialogue systems since many text-based dialogue systems only accept text input. Our approach generates (associates) visual information from input text and generates response text using context vector  fusing associative visual information and sentence textual information. A comparative experiment between our proposed model and a model without association showed that our proposed model is generating useful sentences by associating visual information related to sentences. Furthermore, analysis experiment of visual association showed that our proposed model generates (associates) visual information effective for sentence generation.",

Stemming from a biological inspiration and the auto-encoding principles, a sketch of a cognitive architecture is proposed that should provide ways to implement estimation-oriented control policies.  Computer simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the approach through a foveated inspection of the input data. The pros and cons of the control policy are analyzed in detail, showing interesting promises in terms of processing compression. Though optimizing future posterior entropy over the actions set is shown enough to attain locally optimal action selection, offline calculation using class-specific saliency maps is shown better for it saves processing costs through saccades pathways pre-processing, with a negligible effect on the recognition/compression rates.

Our approach applies deep reinforcement learning by combining convolutional neural networks with DQN to teach agents to fulfill customer demand in an environment that is partially observ-able to them.

Building on prototypical networks, we extend their architecture to what we call Gaussian prototypical networks. Prototypical networks learn a map between images and embedding vectors, and use their clustering for classification. In our model, a part of the encoder output is interpreted as a confidence region estimate about the embedding point, and expressed as a Gaussian covariance matrix. Our network then constructs a direction and class dependent distance metric on the embedding space, using uncertainties of individual data points as weights. We show that Gaussian prototypical networks are a preferred architecture over vanilla prototypical networks with an equivalent number of parameters. We report results consistent with state-of-the-art performance in 1-shot and 5-shot classification both in 5-way and 20-way regime on the Omniglot dataset. We explore artificially down-sampling a fraction of images in the training set, which improves our performance. Our experiments therefore lead us to hypothesize that Gaussian prototypical networks might perform better in less homogeneous, noisier datasets, which are commonplace in real world applications.",

The paper studies the simplest possible case of color invariance: invariance under pixel-wise permutation of the color channels. Thus the network is aware not of the specific color object, but its colorfulness. The data set introduced in the paper consists of images showing crashed cars from which ten classes were extracted. An additional annotation was done which labeled whether the car shown was red or non-red.  The networks were evaluated by their performance on the classification task. With the color annotation we altered the color ratios  in the training data and analyzed the generalization capabilities of the networks on the unaltered test data. We further split the test data in red and non-red cars and did a similar evaluation. It is shown in the paper that an pixel-wise ordering of the rgb-values of the images performs better or at least similarly for small deviations from the true color ratios. The limits of these networks are also discussed.",

In this work, we study these networks in the context of robot motion planning, with a focus on applications to planetary rovers. The key challenging task in learning-based motion planning is to learn a transformation from terrain observations to a suitable navigation reward function. In order to deal with complex terrain observations and policy learning, we propose a value iteration recurrence, referred to as the soft value iteration network (SVIN). SVIN is designed to produce more effective training gradients through the value iteration network. It relies on a soft policy model, where the policy is represented with a probability distribution over all possible actions, rather than a deterministic policy that returns only the best action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in robot motion planning scenarios. In particular, we study the application of SVIN to very challenging problems in planetary rover navigation and present early training results on data gathered by the  Curiosity rover that is currently operating on Mars.",

This mental image is what the DCGAN 'imagines' that the input image might look like under ideal conditions.  The mental image contains a version of the input that is iconic, without any peculiarities that do not contribute to the ideal representation of the input data distribution within a category. A DCGAN learns this association by training an encoder to capture salient features from the original image and a decoder to convert salient features into its associated mental image representation.  Our new approach, which we refer to as a Mental Image DCGAN (MIDCGAN), learns features that are useful for recognizing entire classes of objects, and that this in turn has the benefit of helping single and zero shot recognition.

This paper tries to preliminarily address VAE's intrinsic dimension, real factor, disentanglement and indicator issues theoretically in the idealistic situation and implementation issue practically through noise modeling perspective in the realistic case.  On intrinsic dimension issue, due to information conservation, the idealistic VAE learns and only learns intrinsic factor dimension. Besides, suggested by mutual information separation property, the constraint induced by Gaussian prior to the VAE objective encourages the information sparsity in dimension. On disentanglement issue,   subsequently, inspired by information conservation theorem the clarification on disentanglement in this paper is made. On real factor issue, due to factor equivalence, the idealistic VAE possibly learns any factor set in the equivalence class.  On indicator issue, the behavior of current disentanglement metric is discussed, and several performance indicators regarding the disentanglement and generating influence are subsequently raised to evaluate the performance of VAE model and to supervise the used factors. On implementation issue, the experiments under noise modeling and constraints empirically testify the theoretical analysis and also show their own characteristic in pursuing disentanglement.",

Self-training has been used before the advent of deep learning in order to allow training on limited labelled training data and has shown impressive results in semi-supervised learning. In this work, we combine these two ideas and make GANs self-trainable for semi-supervised learning tasks by exploiting their infinite data generation potential. Results show that using even the simplest form of self-training yields an improvement.

    "abstract": "In the pursuit of increasingly intelligent learning systems, abstraction plays a vital role in enabling sophisticated decisions to be made in complex environments. The options framework provides formalism for such abstraction over sequences of decisions.  However most models require that options be given a priori, presumably specified by hand, which is neither efficient, nor scalable. Indeed, it is preferable to learn options directly from interaction with the environment. Despite several efforts, this remains a difficult problem: many approaches require access to a model of the environmental dynamics, and inferred options are often not interpretable, which limits our ability to explain the system behavior for verification or debugging purposes.  In this work we develop a novel policy gradient method for the automatic learning of policies with options.  This algorithm uses inference methods to simultaneously improve all of the options available to an agent, and thus can be employed in an off-policy manner, without observing option labels. Experimental results show that the options learned can be interpreted. Further, we find that the method presented here is more sample efficient than existing methods, leading to faster and more stable learning of policies with options.",

For this purpose, it builds a model of the world around us and uses this model to infer the external stimulus. Predictive coding has been proposed as a mechanism through which the brain might be able to build such a model of the external environment. However, it is not clear how predictive coding can be used to build deep neural network models of the brain while complying with the architectural constraints imposed by the brain. In this paper, we describe an algorithm to build a deep generative model using predictive coding that can be used to infer latent representations about the stimuli received from external environment. Specifically, we used predictive coding to train a deep neural network on real-world images in a unsupervised learning paradigm. To understand the capacity of the network with regards to modeling the external environment, we studied the latent representations generated by the model on images of objects that are never presented to the model during training. Despite the novel features of these objects the model is able to infer the latent representations for them. Furthermore, the reconstructions of the original images obtained from these latent representations preserve the important details of these objects.",

We propose an efficient training methodology and incrementally growing a DCNN to allow new classes to be learned while sharing part of the base network. Our proposed methodology is inspired by transfer learning techniques, although it does not forget previously learned classes. An updated network for learning new set of classes is formed using previously learned convolutional layers (shared from initial part of base network) with addition of few newly added convolutional kernels included in the later layers of the network.

While both approaches demonstrate considerable compressions, the former often ignores the loss function during compression while the later produces unpredictable compressions. In this paper, we propose a technique that directly minimizes both the model complexity and the changes in the loss function. In this technique, we formulate compression as a constrained optimization problem, and then present a solution for it. We will show that using this technique, we can achieve competitive results.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful models for sequential data. They can approximate arbitrary computations, and have been used successfully in domains such as text and speech. However, the flexibility of RNNs makes them susceptible to overfitting and regularization is important. We develop a noise-based regularization method for RNNs. The idea is simple and easy to implement: we inject noise in the hidden units of the RNN and then maximize the original RNN's likelihood averaged over the injected noise. On a language modeling benchmark, our method achieves better performance than the deterministic RNN and the variational dropout.",

To promote these benefits, it is desired to effectively expand the scale of high-quality yet novel relational medical entity pairs that embody rich medical knowledge in a structured form. To fulfill this goal, we introduce a generative model called Conditional Relationship Variational Autoencoder (CRVAE), which can discover meaningful and novel relational medical entity pairs without the requirement of additional external knowledge. Rather than discriminatively identifying the relationship between two given medical entities in a free-text corpus, we directly model and understand medical relationships from diversely expressed medical entity pairs. The proposed model introduces the generative modeling capacity of variational autoencoder to entity pairs, and has the ability to discover new relational medical entity pairs solely based on the existing entity pairs. Beside entity pairs, relationship-enhanced entity representations are obtained as another appealing benefit of the proposed method. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on real-world medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating relational medical entity pairs that are meaningful and novel.",

    "abstract": "Distributional Semantics Models(DSM) derive word space from linguistic items\nin context. Meaning is obtained by defining a distance measure between vectors\ncorresponding to lexical entities. Such vectors present several problems. This\nwork concentrates on quality of word embeddings, improvement of word embedding\nvectors, applicability of a novel similarity metric used \u2018on top\u2019 of the\nword embeddings. In this paper we provide comparison between two methods\nfor post process improvements to the baseline DSM vectors. The counter-fitting\nmethod which enforces antonymy and synonymy constraints into the Paragram\nvector space representations recently showed improvement in the vectors\u2019 capability\nfor judging semantic similarity. The second method is our novel RESM\nmethod applied to GloVe baseline vectors. By applying the hubness reduction\nmethod, implementing relational knowledge into the model by retrofitting synonyms\nand providing a new ranking similarity definition RESM that gives maximum\nweight to the top vector component values we equal the results for the ESL\nand TOEFL sets in comparison with our calculations using the Paragram and Paragram\n+ Counter-fitting methods. For SIMLEX-999 gold standard since we cannot\nuse the RESM the results using GloVe and PPDB are significantly worse compared\nto Paragram. Apparently, counter-fitting corrects hubness. The Paragram\nor our cosine retrofitting method are state-of-the-art results for the SIMLEX-999\ngold standard. They are 0.2 better for SIMLEX-999 than word2vec with sense\nde-conflation (that was announced to be state-of the-art method for less reliable\ngold standards). Apparently relational knowledge and counter-fitting is more important\nfor judging semantic similarity than sense determination for words. It is to\nbe mentioned, though that Paragram hyperparameters are fitted to SIMLEX-999\nresults. The lesson is that many corrections to word embeddings are necessary\nand methods with more parameters and hyperparameters perform better.\n",

    "abstract": "As machine learning becomes ubiquitous, deployed systems need to be as accu- rate as they can. As a result, machine learning service providers have a surging need for useful, additional training data that benefits training, without giving up all the details about the trained program. At the same time, data owners would like to trade their data for its value, without having to first give away the data itself be- fore receiving compensation. It is difficult for data providers and model providers to agree on a fair price without first revealing the data or the trained model to the other side. Escrow systems only complicate this further, adding an additional layer of trust required of both parties. Currently, data owners and model owners don\u2019t have a fair pricing system that eliminates the need to trust a third party and training the model on the data, which 1) takes a long time to complete, 2) does not guarantee that useful data is paid valuably and that useless data isn\u2019t, without trusting in the third party with both the model and the data. Existing improve- ments to secure the transaction focus heavily on encrypting or approximating the data, such as training on encrypted data, and variants of federated learning. As powerful as the methods appear to be, we show them to be impractical in our use case with real world assumptions for preserving privacy for the data owners when facing black-box models. Thus, a fair pricing scheme that does not rely on secure data encryption and obfuscation is needed before the exchange of data. This pa- per proposes a novel method for fair pricing using data-model efficacy techniques such as influence functions, model extraction, and model compression methods, thus enabling secure data transactions. We successfully show that without running the data through the model, one can approximate the value of the data; that is, if the data turns out redundant, the pricing is minimal, and if the data leads to proper improvement, its value is properly assessed, without placing strong assumptions on the nature of the model. Future work will be focused on establishing a system with stronger transactional security against adversarial attacks that will reveal details about the model or the data to the other party.",

Consider a visual arithmetic task, where the goal is to carry out simple arithmetical algorithms on digits presented under natural conditions (e.g. hand-written, placed randomly). We propose a two-tiered architecture for tackling this kind of problem. The lower tier consists of a heterogeneous collection of information processing modules, which can include pre-trained deep neural networks for locating and extracting characters from the image, as well as modules performing symbolic transformations on the representations extracted by perception. The higher tier consists of a controller, trained using reinforcement learning, which coordinates the modules in order to solve the high-level task. For instance, the controller may learn in what contexts to execute the perceptual networks and what symbolic transformations to apply to their outputs. The resulting model is able to solve a variety of tasks in the visual arithmetic domain,and has several advantages over standard, architecturally homogeneous feedforward networks including improved sample efficiency.",

Predicting multiple task-level is a challenging problem that involves capturing both task semantics and continuous variability over the state of the world. Ideally, we would combine the ability of machine learning to leverage big data for learning the semantics of a task, while using techniques from task planning to reliably generalize to new environment. In this work, we propose a method for learning a model encoding just such a representation for task planning. We learn a neural net that encodes the k most likely outcomes from high level actions from a given world. Our approach creates comprehensible task plans that allow us to predict changes to the environment many time steps into the future. We demonstrate this approach via application to a stacking task in a cluttered environment, where the robot must select between different colored blocks while avoiding obstacles, in order to perform a task. We also show results on a simple navigation task. Our algorithm generates realistic image and pose predictions at multiple points in a given task.\n",

We present a framework that demonstrates a more structured and data efficient alternative to end-to-end complete policy learning on problems where the high-level policy is hard to formulate using traditional optimization or rule based methods but well designed low-level controllers are available. Our framework uses deep reinforcement learning solely to obtain a high-level policy for tactical decision making, while still maintaining a tight integration with the low-level controller, thus getting the best of both worlds. We accomplish this with Q-masking, a technique with which we are able to incorporate prior knowledge, constraints, and information from a low-level controller, directly in to the learning process thereby simplifying the reward function and making learning faster and data efficient. We provide preliminary results in a simulator and show our approach to be more efficient than a greedy baseline, and more successful and safer than human driving.",

The first results were impressive, GANs were shown to be able to generate samples in high dimensional structured spaces, like images and text, that were no copies of the training data. But generative and discriminative learning are quite different. Discriminative learning has a clear end, while generative modeling is an intermediate step to understand the data or generate hypothesis. The quality of implicit density estimation is hard to evaluate, because we cannot tell how well a data is represented by the model. How can we certainly say that a generative process is generating natural images with the same distribution as we do? In this paper, we noticed that even though GANs might not be able to generate samples from the underlying distribution (or we cannot tell at least), they are capturing some structure of the data in that high dimensional space. It is therefore needed to address how we can leverage those estimates produced by GANs in the same way we are able to use other generative modeling algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of training deep fully connected neural networks. Despite much progress in the design of activation functions, novel normalization techniques, and various skip-connection techniques, such networks remain challenging to train due to vanishing or exploding gradients. Our method is based on employing a different class-dependent learning rate to each network weight. Since the learning rates are hyperparameters and not part of the network, we perform an analytical continuation of the network, and create a generalized network. Following this reparameterization, the set of per-class per-weight learning rates are being manipulated during the training iterations. Our results show that the new algorithm leads to improved classification accuracy for both classical and modern activation functions.",

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is\nan unsupervised approach that utilizes two ANNs in one system. The first neural\nnetwork is called the Discriminator and evaluates the quality of images generated\nby the other network, the Generator. However, image generation has no fixed\nsolution, making evaluation difficult. This can be addressed through comparing\ntwo GAN models by letting them evaluate each other; the paper proposes a custom\nimplementation of this evaluation method that allows for comparison between two\nGAN models both overall and throughout the learning process.\nGANs have a reputation for being hard to train. One concrete problem is main-\ntaining the balance between the Generator and Discriminator. As for humans, it\nis easier to rate the quality of images then it is to actually create them. A good\nevaluator is necessary, but it must not out-power the generative model. The paper\nexplores two main approaches to achieve a better balanced GAN model. The first\nmethod makes guided alterations to the usually random input of the Generator.\nThe second method adds an additional Discriminator to the model.

    "abstract": "We propose a framework to understand the unprecedented performance and robustness of deep neural networks using field theory. Correlations between the weights within the same layer can be described by symmetries in that layer, and networks generalize better if such symmetries are broken to reduce the redundancies of the weights. Using a two parameter field theory, we find that the network can break such symmetries itself towards the end of training in a process commonly known in physics as spontaneous symmetry breaking. This corresponds to a network generalizing itself without any user input layers to break the symmetry, but by communication with adjacent layers. In the layer decoupling limit applicable to residual networks (He et al., 2015), we show that the remnant symmetries that survive the non-linear layers are spontaneously broken based on empirical results. The Lagrangian for the non-linear and weight layers together has striking similarities with the one in quantum field theory of a scalar. Using results from quantum field theory we show that our framework is able to explain many experimentally observed phenomena, such as training on random labels with zero error (Zhang et al., 2017), the information bottleneck and the phase transition out of it (Shwartz-Ziv &amp; Tishby, 2017), shattered gradients (Balduzzi et al., 2017), and many more.",

This representation is language-independent with no need of pretraining and produces an encoding with no information loss. It provides an adequate description of the morphology of text, as it is able to represent prefixes, declensions, and inflections with similar vectors and are able to represent even unseen words on the training dataset. Similarly, as it is compact yet sparse, is ideal for speed up training times using tensor processing libraries. As part of this paper, we show that this technique is especially effective when coupled with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for text classification at character-level. We apply two variants of CNN coupled with it. Experimental results show that it drastically reduces the number of parameters to be optimized, resulting in competitive classification accuracy values in only a fraction of the time spent by one-hot encoding representations, thus enabling training in commodity hardware.",

    "abstract": "This research concerns solving the semi-supervised learning problem with generative adversarial networks for regression. In contrast to classification, where only a limited number of distinct classes is given, the regression task is defined as predicting continuous labels for a given dataset. Semi-supervised learning is of vital importance for the applications where a small number of labeled samples is available, or labeling samples is difficult or expensive to collect. A case in point is autonomous driving in which obtaining sufficient labeled samples covering all driving conditions is costly. In this context, we can take advantage of semi-supervised learning techniques with groundbreaking generative models, such as generative adversarial networks. However, almost all proposed GAN-based semi-supervised techniques in the literature are focused on solving the classification problem. Hence, developing a GAN-based semi-supervised method for the regression task is still an open problem. In this work, two different architectures will be proposed to address this problem. In summary, our introduced method is able to predict continuous labels for a training dataset which has only a limited number of labeled samples. Moreover, the application of this technique for solving the end-to-end task in autonomous driving will be presented.  \nWe performed several experiments over a publicly available driving dataset to evaluate our proposed method, and the results are very promising. The results show that our approach generates images with high quality, gives smaller label prediction error and leads to a more stable training compared with the state-of-the-art Improved GAN technique~\\citep{ImprovedGAN2016}.",

    "abstract": "Labeled text classification datasets are typically only available in a few select languages. In order to train a model for e.g news categorization in a language $L_t$ without a suitable text classification dataset there are two options. The first option is to create a new labeled dataset by hand, and the second option is to transfer label information from an existing labeled dataset in a source language $L_s$ to the target language $L_t$. In this paper we propose a method for sharing label information across languages by means of a language independent text encoder. The encoder will give almost identical representations to multilingual versions of the same text. This means that labeled data in one language can be used to train a classifier that works for the rest of the languages. The encoder is trained independently of any concrete classification task and can therefore subsequently be used for any classification task.  We show that it is possible to obtain good performance even in the case where only a comparable corpus of texts is available. ",

    "abstract": "The Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) has been proven to speed up learning and improve the classification performance over activation functions such as ReLU and Leaky ReLU for convolutional neural networks. The reasons behind the improved behavior are that ELU reduces the bias shift, it saturates for large negative inputs and it is continuously differentiable. However, it remains open whether ELU has the optimal shape and we address the quest for a superior activation function.\nWe use a new formulation to tune a piecewise linear activation function during training, to investigate the above question, and learn the shape of the locally optimal activation function. With this tuned activation function, the classification performance is improved and the resulting, learned activation function shows to be ELU-shaped irrespective if it is initialized as a RELU, LReLU or ELU. Interestingly, the learned activation function does not exactly pass through the origin indicating that a shifted ELU-shaped activation function is preferable. This observation leads us to introduce the Shifted Exponential Linear Unit (ShELU) as a new activation function.\nExperiments on Cifar-100 show that the classification performance is further improved when using the ShELU activation function in comparison with ELU. The improvement is achieved when learning an individual bias shift for each neuron.",

    "abstract": "Any autoencoder network can be turned into a generative model by imposing an arbitrary prior distribution on its hidden code vector. Variational Autoencoder uses a KL divergence penalty to impose the prior, whereas Adversarial Autoencoder uses generative adversarial networks.  A straightforward modification of Adversarial Autoencoder can be achieved by replacing the adversarial network with maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) network. This replacement leads to a new set of probabilistic autoencoder which is also discussed in our paper.\n\nHowever, an essential challenge remains in both of these probabilistic autoencoders, namely that the only source of randomness at the output of encoder, is the training data itself.  Lack of enough stochasticity can make the optimization problem non-trivial. As a result, they can lead to degenerate solutions where the generator collapses into sampling only a few modes.\n\nOur proposal is to replace the adversary of the adversarial autoencoder by a space of {\\it stochastic} functions. This replacement introduces a a new source of randomness which can be considered as a continuous control for encouraging {\\it explorations}. This prevents the adversary from fitting too closely to the generator and therefore leads to more diverse set of generated samples. Consequently, the decoder serves as a better generative network which unlike MMD nets scales linearly with the amount of data. We provide mathematical and empirical evidence on how this replacement outperforms the pre-existing architectures.   ",

    "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental machine learning method. The quality of its results is dependent on the data distribution. For this reason, deep neural networks can be used for learning better representations of the data. In this paper, we propose a systematic taxonomy for clustering with deep learning, in addition to a review of methods from the field. Based on our taxonomy, creating new methods is more straightforward. We also propose a new approach which is built on the taxonomy and surpasses some of the limitations of some previous work. Our experimental evaluation on image datasets shows that the method approaches state-of-the-art clustering quality, and performs better in some cases.",

In this paper, I attempt to further our understanding of the subject, by developing a simple, but highly accurate generative approach to solve the word analogy problem for the case when all terms involved in the problem are nouns. My results demonstrate the ambiguities associated with learning the relationship between a word pair, and the role of the training dataset in determining the relationship which gets most highlighted. Furthermore, my results show that the ability of a model to accurately solve the word analogy problem may not be indicative of a model\u2019s ability to learn the relationship between a word pair the way a human does.\n",

We have found our CNN architecture to be highly accurate (99.79%) and fast while maintaining low False Positive and False Negative rates (&lt; 0.01% and 0.15% respectively).

While\ndialog systems have become increasingly popular during the last couple of years,\ncurrent task oriented dialog systems are still mainly reactive and users tend to\ninitiate conversations. In this paper, we propose to introduce the paradigm of contextual\nbandits as framework for pro-active dialog systems. Contextual bandits\nhave been the model of choice for the problem of reward maximization with partial\nfeedback since they fit well to the task description. As a second contribution,\nwe introduce and explore the notion of memory into this paradigm. We propose\ntwo differentiable memory models that act as parts of the parametric reward estimation\nfunction. The first one, Convolutional Selective Memory Networks, uses\na selection of past interactions as part of the decision support. The second model,\ncalled Contextual Attentive Memory Network, implements a differentiable attention\nmechanism over the past interactions of the agent. The goal is to generalize\nthe classic model of contextual bandits to settings where temporal information\nneeds to be incorporated and leveraged in a learnable manner. Finally, we illustrate\nthe usability and performance of our model for building a pro-active mobile\nassistant through an extensive set of experiments.",

While traditional explicit regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, and data augmentation are still being used in these new models, little about the regularization and generalization effects of these new structures have been studied. \nBesides being deeper than their predecessors, could newer architectures like ResNet and DenseNet also benefit from their structures' implicit regularization properties? \nIn this work, we investigate the skip connection's effect on network's generalization features. Through experiments, we show that certain neural network architectures contribute to their generalization abilities. Specifically, we study the effect that low-level features have on generalization performance when they are introduced to deeper layers in DenseNet, ResNet as well as networks with 'skip connections'. We show that these low-level representations do help with generalization in multiple settings when both the quality and quantity of training data is decreased. ",

The fixed-length vector can therefore represent features only in the selected dimensions. In addition, we propose using rolling fixed window approach to generate samples.

However, relatively little work has explored the internal structure and properties of spaces of sentence vectors.

In particular, we show that cosine similarity between sentence vectors and document vectors is strongly correlated with sentence importance and that vector semantics can identify and correct gaps between the sentences chosen so far and the document. In addition, we identify specific dimensions which are linked to effective summaries. To our knowledge, this is the first time specific dimensions of sentence embeddings have been connected to sentence properties. We also compare the features of different methods of sentence embeddings. Many of these insights have applications in uses of sentence embeddings far beyond summarization.",

However, it is impossible for the police to track down the impersonators with disguised faces from the ATM footage. The proposed deep convolutional neural network is trained to identify, in real time, whether the user in the captured image is trying to cloak his identity or not. The output of the DCNN is then reported to the ATM to take appropriate steps and prevent the swindler from completing the transaction. The network is trained using a dataset of images captured in similar situations as of an ATM.

    "abstract": "Learning effective text representations is a key foundation for numerous machine learning and NLP applications. While the celebrated Word2Vec technique yields semantically rich word representations, it is less clear whether sentence or document representations should be built upon word representations or from scratch. Recent work has demonstrated that a distance measure between documents called \\emph{Word Mover's Distance} (WMD) that aligns semantically similar words, yields unprecedented KNN classification accuracy. However, WMD is very expensive to compute, and is harder to apply beyond simple KNN than feature embeddings. In this paper, we propose the \\emph{Word Mover's Embedding } (WME), a novel approach to building an unsupervised document (sentence) embedding from pre-trained word embeddings. Our technique extends the theory of \\emph{Random Features} to show convergence of the inner product between WMEs to a positive-definite kernel that can be interpreted as a soft version of (inverse) WMD. The proposed embedding is more efficient and flexible than WMD in many situations. As an example, WME with a simple linear classifier reduces the computational cost of WMD-based KNN \\emph{from cubic to linear} in document length and \\emph{from quadratic to linear} in number of samples, while simultaneously improving accuracy. In experiments on 9 benchmark text classification datasets and 22 textual similarity tasks the proposed technique consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, with significantly higher accuracy on problems of short length.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning(RL) offers robotics tasks a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors.[1]\nReinforcement Learning is an branch of Machine Learning inspired by behaviorist psychology[wiki- Reinforcemenr Learning], concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\nThe basic idea of Reinforcement Learning is to obtain a policy that extract more reward from the environment by picking actions given a state.\nBy policy, we mean a decision maker (Agent) that decide on an action based on some parameterized rules given an input observation of environment (State). The policy can be a set of weight that linearly combine the features in a state or different structured Neural Network. The environment in Reinforcement Learning context provide the agent a new state and reward immediately after the agent takes a specific action.\nFrom a more broad view, the Machine Learning method was mainly three folds. The Supervised Learning, Semi-supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. The supervised learning network was trained given a dataset including the observation data and the corresponding categorization. The latter was given a dataset that no classification is label to the observation data. For reinforcement Learning, it is more close to supervised learning, while its label is obtained by exploring the environment and get feedback (reward, r) from it. The RL algorithm marks the policy that generates the highest score as the training target and make small change of its parameters (or weights, \u03b8) towards that policy until the policy converge.\nIn this report, we mainly focus on the methods of Reinforcement Learning methods for robotics.",

    "abstract": "Along with the performance increase of the neural network, both the number of layers and the number of parameters in each layer are becoming larger and larger. Therefore, there are more and more works trying to compress the neural network efficiently while keeping the performance. However, all of them have not taken the similarity among the kernels into consideration. In this paper, we try to organize the kernels in different channels into a frame and encode the frames using block-based video coding methods. First, we try to reshape the weights in different channels into a pseudo sequence. Second, after obtaining all the frames in the videos, we will convert the weight into the PCA domain to obtain a more compact representation. Then both the intra prediction and the inter prediction will be performed in the PCA domain to achieve better performance. Finally, the uniform quantization and entropy coding will be used to encode the residue blocks. The experimental results show that we can achieve $58$ times compression for the classical VGG-16 model. Not only with very high compression ratio, the proposed method can also provide the benefits of getting a better balance between the bits per weight and the error in more precise granularity by adjusting the quantization parameters.",

    "abstract": "The fabrication of semiconductor involves etching process to remove selected areas from wafers. However, the measurement of etched structure in micro-graph heavily relies on time-consuming manual routines. Traditional image processing usually demands on large number of annotated data and the performance is still poor. We treat this challenge as segmentation problem and use deep learning approach to detect masks of objects in etched structure of wafer. Then, we use simple image processing to carry out automatic measurement on the objects. We attempt Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate more data to overcome the problem of very limited dataset. We download 10 SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) images of 4 types from Internet, based on which we carry out our experiments. Our deep learning based method demonstrates superiority over image processing approach with  mean accuracy reaching over 96% for the measurements, compared with the ground truth. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that deep learning has been applied in semiconductor industry for automatic measurement.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy).  Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pretrained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis.  We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pretrained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.\n",

    "abstract": "Language style transfer is the problem of migrating the content of a source sentence to a target style. In many applications, parallel training data are not available and source sentences to be transferred may have arbitrary and unknown styles. In this paper, we present an encoder-decoder framework under this problem setting. Each sentence is encoded into its content and style latent representations. By recombining the content with the target style, we can decode a sentence aligned in the target domain. To adequately constrain the encoding and decoding functions, we couple them with two loss functions. The first is a style discrepancy loss, enforcing that the style representation accurately encodes the style information guided by the discrepancy between the sentence style and the target style. The second is a cycle consistency loss, which ensures that the transferred sentence should preserve the content of the original sentence disentangled from its style. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed model on two tasks: sentiment modification of restaurant reviews, and dialog response revision with a romantic style.",

Our system learns word and sentence embeddings jointly by training a multilingual skip-gram model together with a cross-lingual sentence similarity model. We construct sentence embeddings by processing word embeddings with an LSTM and by taking an average of the outputs. Our architecture can transparently use both monolingual and sentence aligned bilingual corpora to learn multilingual embeddings, thus covering a vocabulary significantly larger than the vocabulary of the bilingual corpora alone. Our model shows competitive performance in a standard cross-lingual document classification task. We also show the effectiveness of our method in a low-resource scenario.",

    "abstract": "We study the loss surface of neural networks that involve only rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities from a theoretical point-of-view. Any such network defines a piecewise multilinear form in parameter space. As a consequence, optima of such networks generically occur in non-differentiable regions of parameter space and so any understanding of such networks must carefully take into account their non-smooth nature. We then proceed to leverage this multilinear structure in an analysis of a neural network with one hidden-layer. Under the assumption of linearly separable data, the piecewise bilinear structure of the loss allows us to provide an explicit  description of all  critical points.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a distributed damped Newton method in which sample size is gradually increasing to quickly obtain a solution whose empirical loss is under satisfactory statistical accuracy. Our proposed method is multistage in which the solution of one stage serves as a warm start for the next stage which contains more samples (including the samples in the previous stage). This overall multistage algorithm reduce the number of passes over data. Moreover, our algorithm in nature is easy to be distributed and shares the strong scaling property indicating that acceleration is always expected by using more computing nodes. Various iteration complexity results regarding descent direction computation and stopping criteria are analyzed under convex setting. Our results of experiments illustrate that the proposed algorithm can outperform other comparable methods for training machine learning tasks including neural networks.",

    "abstract": "There has been an increasing use of neural networks for music information retrieval tasks. In this paper, we empirically investigate different ways of improving the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on spectral audio features. More specifically, we explore three aspects of CNN design: depth of the network, the use of residual blocks along with the use of grouped convolution, and global aggregation over time. The application context is singer classification and singing performance embedding and we believe the conclusions extend to other types of music analysis using convolutional neural networks. The results show that global time aggregation helps to improve the performance of CNNs the most. Another contribution of this paper is the release of a singing recording dataset that can be used for training and evaluation. ",

    "abstract": " Binarized Neural networks (BNNs) have been shown to be effective in improving network efficiency during the inference phase, after the network has been trained. However, BNNs only binarize the model parameters and activations during propagations. Therefore, BNNs do not offer significant efficiency improvements during training, since the gradients are still propagated and used with high precision. \n \n We show there is no inherent difficulty in training BNNs using \"Binarized BackPropagation\" (BBP), in which we also binarize the gradients. To avoid significant degradation in test accuracy, we simply increase the number of filter maps in a each convolution layer. Using BBP on dedicated hardware can potentially significantly improve the execution efficiency (\\emph{e.g.}, reduce dynamic memory footprint, memory bandwidth and computational energy) and speed up the training process with an appropriate hardware support, even after such an increase in network size. Moreover, our method is ideal for distributed learning as it reduces the communication costs significantly (e.g., by ~32). Using this method, we demonstrate a minimal loss in classification accuracy on several datasets and topologies.",
